1,98,M. Chapoutier 1999 Le Méal Ermitage  (Hermitage),"Chapoutier's selections of the best parcels of vines in Hermitage are set to become legendary. Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation. This cuvée is the best of the collection, with its brooding, opaque character, suggesting rather than revealing power at this stage. Age it until your new-born baby is old enough to drink, and it will be just about ready.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,150.0,Le Méal Ermitage,Rhône-style Red Blend,Hermitage,,Rhône Valley,France,M. Chapoutier
2,97,J.L. Chave 1999  Hermitage,"Jean-Louis, the son of Gérard Chave, is now in charge of the family business, as well as being president of the Hermitage wine producers. He is continuing the family tradition of making powerful statements of Syrah from Hermitage, combining massive structure and over-powering perfumes. This 1999 seems to have the best of the traditional world of tannic immensity and the modern world of beautiful, ripe fruit. A wine that will age for a very long time.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,125.0,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Hermitage,,Rhône Valley,France,J.L. Chave
3,96,Colgin 1999 Herb Lamb Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Aromas lean toward black cherry, chocolate and herbs, which sally forth on the palate serving up more dense fruit, licorice, coffee and beautiful toast flavors. Tannins are smooth, supple and ripe. Long, lush and decadent on the finish.",,,150.0,Herb Lamb Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Colgin
4,96,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 SLV Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Certainly one of the successes of the vintage. Packed with cassis, sage, plum, tobacco, earth and smoky oak, and perfectly dry and balanced. Sheer joy in the mouth, like liquid velvet. It changes every second, offering up tiers of flavors through the spicy finish.",,,100.0,SLV,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
5,96,Dalla Valle 1999 Maya Red (Napa Valley),"Plush, smooth and packed tight with complex flavors. Blackberry, anise, black cherry, tar, coal, spice, earth and herbs remain tightly wound, waiting patiently to reveal their full charm in time. Supple, smooth tannins and beautiful balance give this wine classic elegance.",,,120.0,Maya,Red Blend,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Dalla Valle
6,96,E. Guigal 1998 La Mouline  (Côte Rôtie),"Even though the 42 months this wine has spent in new wood give it an intensely toasty character, the enormously soft, perfumed fruits and ripe, sweet flavors that go along with the wood produce a finely tuned, balanced wine that should age well over many years. As an expression of pure Syrah, there are few better.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,175.0,La Mouline,Rhône-style Red Blend,Côte Rôtie,,Rhône Valley,France,E. Guigal
7,95,Quilceda Creek 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon (Washington),"After “fiddling around,” as he puts it, with blends in his '96 and '97 cabs, winemaker Alex Golitzin decided to go with straight Cabernet in '98, an exceptional vintage for Washington State. This is a tight, focused effort, with powerful black fruits augmented with herbs and spices and a hint of mineral. Young, tart and tannic, it will continue to improve as it knits together over the years. Editors' Choice.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,60.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Washington,Washington Other,Washington,US,Quilceda Creek
8,95,E. Guigal 1998 La Turque  (Côte Rôtie),"A firm, dry, foursquare wine that has power and structure rather than the immediate perfumes of La Mouline, the partner cuvée from Guigal. This is the wine for those who want power with big tannins, and they don't come more powerful or tannic than this. Its aging potential is enormous:  after 10 years there should be more sign of the perfumed fruit which is there, somewhere.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,175.0,La Turque,Rhône-style Red Blend,Côte Rôtie,,Rhône Valley,France,E. Guigal
9,95,Domaine Jean-Michel Gerin 1999 La Landonne  (Côte Rôtie),"Here is a superbly rich and smooth wine.

10,95,Éric & Jöel Durand 1999 Empreintes  (Cornas),"A huge, ink-black wine with all the brooding majesty that gives Cornas its reputation. A blockbuster with enormous rich, sweet tannins. At the end it is the quality of the superripe fruit from old vines that dominates, but it is certainly a wine to keep for generations.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,37.0,Empreintes,Rhône-style Red Blend,Cornas,,Rhône Valley,France,Éric & Jöel Durand
11,95,E. Guigal 1999  Hermitage,"A massive wine, with its opaque, dense purple color, its huge tannins and its tight, powerful structure. When it develops—maybe in 10 or 15 years' time—the perfumed, juicy Syrah fruits that are just suggested for the moment are going to be as dominant as the tannins are now. What a wine it will be then.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,55.0,,Rhône-style Red Blend,Hermitage,,Rhône Valley,France,E. Guigal
12,95,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars 1998 Cask 23 Red (Napa Valley),"What a great success. Oozes with blackcurrant jam and cassis and a dash of black pepper. Flamboyant oak adds a perfume of vanilla and smoke. Fleshy, long and full, this beautiful wine is not a monster, but it coats the palate with spicy flavors that epitomize class and style.",,,150.0,Cask 23,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Stag's Leap Wine Cellars
13,95,Switchback Ridge 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A beautifully balanced wine, framed in plush, ripe, velvety tannins and backed by lush, black cherry, plum, blackberry, spice, herb and chocolate flavors. Gloriously complex, seamless in its elegance, the wine is packed with charm and personality; long on the finish.",,,65.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Switchback Ridge
14,94,Dalla Valle 1999 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Ripe, rich and elegant, this wine is brimming with black plum, strawberry, cassis, chocolate, spice and herb notes.

15,94,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 Chevalier de Sterimberg White (Hermitage),"Jaboulet's white Hermitage is named after the crusading knight who built and settled in the small chapel on the Hermitage hill. The wine itself is powerful, rich and concentrated, with heady perfumes of wild flowers and nuts. The palate combines a hint of wood, a full-bodied, oily texture and a stunning burst of acidity that leaves a crisp aftertaste.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,75.0,Chevalier de Sterimberg,Rhône-style White Blend,Hermitage,,Rhône Valley,France,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
16,94,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 La Chapelle  (Hermitage),"Jaboulet's view of its most famous wine seems to have changed. Although the concentrated, dense tannins and big black fruit flavors are still there, it has lost the huge brooding presence of past vintages, and now has a veneer of sophistication with superripe fruit, plums and dark jam tastes. Whether this 1999 will age as well as older vintages remains to be seen, but it will certainly be ready to drink sooner.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,131.0,La Chapelle,Rhône-style Red Blend,Hermitage,,Rhône Valley,France,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
17,94,Pride Mountain 1999 Merlot (Napa-Sonoma),"What power and drama have gone into this wonderful wine. Sheer Pomerol, with pencil shaving, black cherry, cedar, chocolate and gamy-meaty aromas and flavors, tinged with violets, and the most voluptuous mouthfeel. Sheer hedonism right through the long sweet finish.",,,48.0,,Merlot,Napa-Sonoma,North Coast,California,US,Pride Mountain
18,94,Delas Frères 1999 Les Bessards  (Hermitage),"Old vines in the Les Bessards vineyard on the Hermitage hill have offered up a majestic wine that has considerable power. With its strong, firm tannins and intense, brooding dark fruits, this is a wine that has obviously been made to last. With little use of new wood for this wine (only 10%), the structure and the complexity come entirely from the enormously ripe fruit and traditional fermentation.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,98.0,Les Bessards,Rhône-style Red Blend,Hermitage,,Rhône Valley,France,Delas Frères
19,94,E. Guigal 1999 Brune et Blonde  (Côte Rôtie),"The perfect combination of elegance and purity of fruit give this famous wine, a blend of fruit from both slopes of the hills above Ampuis, a great sense of style as well as power. The Syrah perfumes, at their richest and coolest, combine with black fruits to give an overwhelming impression of immense fruit flavors.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,40.0,Brune et Blonde,Syrah,Côte Rôtie,,Rhône Valley,France,E. Guigal
20,94,Hedges 1999 Red Mountain Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Hedges is one of a handful of Washington wineries producing top- caliber wines in significant quantities. This is their best deeply colored, elegant and Bordeaux-like in style and substance. Powerful, muscular black cherry fruit blends with dense, firm tannins, highlighted with elements of iron and earth. The wine, though young and compressed, is a perfect expression of Red Mountain Cabernet. About 20% Merlot is also in the blend. 2,100 six-bottle cases made.

21,90,La Jota Vineyard 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"A strong Cabernet that's so tightly wound in tannins, it's hard to appreciate, despite plenty of fruit. There's also a green olive earthiness to the sweet blackberries and cedar. Showing its immaturity now, so give it a good six years in the cellar.",,,65.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Howell Mountain,Napa,California,US,La Jota Vineyard
22,90,Montes 2010 Limited Selection Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"This SB has one of Chile's best track records for high quality. The nose and flavors both exceed norms, with the former showing bold citrus, lime and melon aromas and the latter revolving around grapefruit, lime and gooseberry. It's ripe, healthy, pithy, acid-driven and piercing. Summer sipping calls.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,15.0,Limited Selection,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Leyda Valley,Chile,Montes
23,90,Donnachiara 2006  Taurasi,"This firm and austere Taurasi opens with dark aromas of plum cake, chocolate, dried currant, cola and smoky barbecue sauce. The tannins are firm and dense and the wine needs a few more years of cellar aging before it softens.",,,34.0,,Aglianico,Taurasi,,Southern Italy,Italy,Donnachiara
24,90,Dr. Loosen 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Spätlese Riesling (Mosel),"Loosen's 2009 spätlese from the Wehlener Sonnenuhr is a lush, medium-bodied wine loaded with honey and peaches. It's superripe and succulent, with a long, fruity finish.

25,90,Dry River 2009 Late Harvest Riesling (Martinborough),"Plump and slightly sweet, this late-harvest Riesling comes in at 10% alcohol—something along the lines of a rich spätlese in terms of its alcohol-acid-sugar balance. Notes of pineapple and crushed stone open up to melon fruit on the palate and finish long, with a bit of cinnamon or ginger spice.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,55.0,Late Harvest,Riesling,,,Martinborough,New Zealand,Dry River
26,90,Kingston Family 2009 Alazan Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley),"Always at the top of the Chilean Pinot heap is this true, complex wine from Kingston Family. The nose features light raspberry, citrus, oceanic brine and toasty, creamy oak.

Finishes with purity, smooth tannins and herbal twinges.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,30.0,Alazan,Pinot Noir,,,Casablanca Valley,Chile,Kingston Family
27,90,Kumeu River 2008 Coddington Chardonnay (Kumeu),"Perhaps the biggest of Kumeu River's 2008 Chardonnays, the Coddington offers waves of tropical fruit—pineapple and carambola—allied to mouthfilling richness and balanced by citrusy acids and hints of roasted nuts. Drink now.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,42.0,Coddington,Chardonnay,,,Kumeu,New Zealand,Kumeu River
28,90,Nanni Copé 2008 Sabbie di Sopra il Bosco Red (Terre del Volturno),"Here's a new producer from southern Italy who presents a very interesting blend of Pallagrello (70%), Aglianico and Casavecchia.

29,90,Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt 2009 Piesporter Goldtröpfchen Trocken GG Riesling (Mosel),"Like the Josephshöfer bottling, von Kesselstatt's 2009 GG from the Piesporter Goldtröpfchen boasts a salty minerality that underscores the ripe flavors of peach and orange zest.

30,90,S.A. Prüm 2009 Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"Makes an interesting contrast with the J.J. Prüm bottling from the same site, weighing in at a full 1.5% less in finished alcohol, and showing mineral-inflected passion fruit flavors and a touch of vanilla. The sweetness is finely balanced by mouthwatering acidity on the finish.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,25.0,Wehlener Sonnenuhr Kabinett,Riesling,,,Mosel,Germany,S.A. Prüm
31,90,Errazuriz 2008 The Blend Limited Edition Red (Aconcagua Valley),"Alluring on the nose, with a ton of dried spice, mocha and tobacco aromas to go with beefy, berry fruit notes. Despite its darkness and size, this wine delivers bright, juicy acidity and then herbal cassis and berry flavors. Tobacco, herbs and length define the finish. A blend of five red grapes, including Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot; drink now through 2013.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,35.0,The Blend Limited Edition,Red Blend,,,Aconcagua Valley,Chile,Errazuriz
32,90,Feudi di San Gregorio 2009 Pietracalda  (Fiano di Avellino),"Pietracalda (which translates into “hot rock”) seems indeed to release aromas of sunbaked granite or river stone over lush background tones of peach, pear and yellow lemon zest.

36,90,Hartenberg 2007 The Stork Shiraz (Stellenbosch),"Medium weight with a satiny smooth texture and great balance, this is a stellar Syrah with great complexity between the rich dark fruit flavors and forest spice.

37,90,Archery Summit 2008 Premier Cuvée Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A fine, elegant Pinot Noir, still in its infancy, with bright cranberry and raspberry fruit taking center stage. A shimmering, vivid, youthful vitality elevates the fruit flavors, with juicy acidity and restrained oak influence. Though this is the least expensive wine in the Archery Summit portfolio, it may surprise those who cellar it. Some extra years in the bottle could bring out unsuspected depth and power.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,48.0,Premier Cuvée,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Archery Summit
38,90,Würtz 2008 Geyerscheiss Riesling (Rheinhessen),"A unique style of Riesling, naturally fermented on the skins for 20 days prior to pressing.

40,90,Brandborg 2009 Gewürztraminer (Umpqua Valley),"Do you like lemon drop cocktails? This is a lemon drop wine —so ripe and round and sweetly lemony it could almost pass for Limoncello. Despite the almost 14% alcohol, there is some sweetness, as you might find in a late harvest wine, albeit concealed by the acidity. Rose petals and talcum powder flavors coalesce into a firm, full, fruity, slightly sweet and also quite fragrant finish.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,16.0,,Gewürztraminer,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Oregon,US,Brandborg
41,90,Château Fonréaud 2006  Listrac-Médoc,"Firm tannins mark this as a wine for aging. At the same time, the sweet and ripe fruit gives weight and richness.

It's less herbal and more powerful than the former, but not as muscular as the latter. The tannins are still silky, yet there's great intensity, ending on a long, slightly charred note.

143,90,Dürnberg 2015 Tradition Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Weinviertel),"Ripe, almost tropical fruit notes appear: pineapple and orange zest are tempered by peppery yeastiness which becomes stronger and more expressive and textured on the palate.

166,94,Château Montrose 2006  Saint-Estèphe,"Yes, this wine is tannic. To begin with it seems austere and mineral. But then the substrate of black berry juice asserts itself.

408,91,Peter Franus 2006 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley),"Quite a good wine, with Cabernet-esque blackberries and black currants, and a rich toastiness from charred oak.

435,92,René Muré 2014 Signature Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Earth and roses, lemon zest and orange flesh: these are the contrasts of this refreshing, toned but textured Gewurztraminer that shows the full weight of its rose perfume on the palate.

436,92,Terra d'Oro 2013 Teroldego (Amador County),"A remarkable full-bodied wine, this has great concentration and depth of flavor, with a dense but fine-grained texture to go along with it.

445,84,Debonné 2006 Reserve Riesling (Grand River Valley),"Fresh minerality and dancing floral notes make the nose on this reserve Riesling enticing. On the palate, typical Riesling flavors of spice and flowers are slightly slowed by a viscous, heavier mouthfeel, but overall, the wine is harmonious.

The tannins are a bit grainy, however and the confected fruit flavors are on the simple side. Serve with steak, hamburgers.",,,20.0,Miller's Cove Red,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,New York,US,Keuka Spring
476,81,Red Mud 2007 Unoaked Chardonnay (South Australia),"Fresh but faint aromas of hay, candlewax and grass open this honest but simple effort.

Imported by Nelwood Wines.",,,15.0,Unoaked,Chardonnay,South Australia,,South Australia,Australia,Red Mud
477,81,Espuela del Gaucho 2007 Gaucho Spur Malbec (Mendoza),"A lean, acidic Malbec that defies the tried and true model of richness and lots of flavor. It has rhubarb and green raspberry aromas, while the palate is short, tart and herbal. Not a lot of definition here.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,9.0,Gaucho Spur,Malbec,Mendoza,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Espuela del Gaucho
478,81,Castel Grisch 2007 Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"Instantly appealing aromas of rose water and kiwi fruit make for a great opener but yield to a one-dimensional palate.

479,80,Alta Vista 2007 Finca Monte Lindo Chardonnay (Mendoza),"Strange Chardonnay. It smells and tastes more like feeble Torrontés than Chard.

481,80,Catharine Valley 2005 Reserve Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes),"Charming aromas of tobacco leaf and strawberries promise good things to come but the palate does not follow through. While some boysenberry flavors appeal, the wine is thin in the mouth.

484,80,Rooster Hill 2007 Estate Gewürztraminer (Finger Lakes),"While the aromas show some promise, they are disappointingly faint for a Gewürztraminer.

485,80,McGregor 2006 Pinot Noir (Finger Lakes),This wine falls short of its rather lofty ambitions with lavish new French oak treatment resulting in a diminished fruit profile. Sawdust notes dominate the nose while the faintest hint of cherry can be detected on the palate. Finishes a bit tart. A good choice for those hankering for a vanilla milkshake.,,,28.0,,Pinot Noir,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,New York,US,McGregor

487,80,Castel Grisch 2007 Chancellor (Finger Lakes),"Crisp and exceptionally low in tannin, the Chancellor grape is perhaps this continent's answer to the Gamay of Beaujolais. The brilliant garnet hue of this example will force you to pick up the glass. Unfotunately, what you find there won't hold your attention for very long.

490,97,Iron Horse NV Joy! Sparkling (Green Valley),"Available in magnum only, this is an occasional bottling from the winery. A winery spokeperson told me my bottle was entirely 1993 vintage, but not all other bottles are. The wine is extraordinarily fine, but compared to other California bubblies, it's sandpapery and almost harsh at this point. As it warms up in the glass it shows an immense toasted nut and grilled fruit richness with an impossibly long finish.

1039,89,Quinta do Portal 2008 Late Bottled Vintage  (Port),"With its stumpy, old fashioned bottle and cork, this is an LBV for aging.

1051,89,Monteviejo 2007 Malbec-Syrah (Uco Valley),"This blend of 80% Malbec with 20% Syrah is dense and rich but a touch flat on the nose, with blueberry and cumin accents. The palate feels heavy and tannic, while flavors of blackberry, prune and herbs are nice.

1056,89,Bedell 2010 Cabernet Franc (North Fork of Long Island),"While it shares the same floral overtones, the 2010 Bedell Cabernet Franc is a marked contrast to the demure 2011 vintage.

1060,89,O. Fournier 2010 Alfa Crux Sauvignon Blanc (Uco Valley),"With feline aromas of juniper bush, grass and sweaty citrus, this is true Sauvignon Blanc.

1391,88,Sumarroca 2005 Brut Nature Gran Reserva Cava Sparkling (Penedès),"Dry, pure and attractive on the nose, with crisp apple and lemon-lime flavors.

1392,88,Domaine Alfred 2005 Califa Pinot Noir (Edna Valley),"Represents a big improvement over last year's Califa; this one returns to dryness thanks to the cool vintage. Edna Valley acidity brightens cherry, root beer, vanilla bean and oak flavors. Dry and complex now, the wine should peak in a year or so, then hold through 2010.",,,60.0,Califa,Pinot Noir,Edna Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Domaine Alfred
1393,88,Clos du Val 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley),"This big Chardonnay, which was entirely barrel fermented, is tasting a bit too oaky. It was sourced from the winery's estate Carneros vineyard and shows that appellation's crisp acids, along with bright tropical fruit and spice flavors. But the sweet, charry vanilla and caramel from barrels tends to dominate.",,,42.0,Reserve,Chardonnay,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Clos du Val
1394,88,Mas de Monistrol NV MPX Brut Sparkling (Cava),"Pretty pear, apple and other dusty white-fruit aromas start this cleansing cava on its way to pure citrus, Granny Smith apple and lime flavors. It has a mildly linear, angular feel but it doesn't come across sheer or sour; to the contrary, it's balanced and generous with its fruit.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,11.0,MPX Brut,Sparkling Blend,Cava,,Catalonia,Spain,Mas de Monistrol

1397,88,DFJ Vinhos 2006 Alvarinho-Chardonnay White (Estremadura),"In his continual quest for unusual blends, DFJ winemaker José Neiva has come up with this mix of the Vinho Verde grape Alvarinho and Chardonnay. When it is young, as here, the fresh, crisp Alvarinho dominates, giving lively, vibrant green-fruit flavors. Some weight underneath hints at the Chardonnay.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,Alvarinho-Chardonnay,Portuguese White,,,Estremadura,Portugal,DFJ Vinhos

1399,88,J. Lohr 2005 Arroyo Seco Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Barrel-fermented and aged on the lees, this Burgundian-style Chard is creamy and rich in ripe tropical fruit flavors and new oak.

1401,88,Quinta de Chocapalha 2005 Red (Estremadura),"A powerful expression of Portuguese varieties, with dense tannins, dark fruit flavors and ripeness.

1402,88,Smith & Hook 2005 Grand Reserve Red (Central Coast),"Smith & Hook has tried hard to perfect their Cab, transferring fruit sourcing from Monterey to Paso Robles.

The cherry and blackberry flavors are balanced by firm tannins and crisp acids, making it a versatile wine at the table.",,,25.0,Grand Reserve,Cabernet Blend,Central Coast,Central Coast,California,US,Smith & Hook
1403,88,Talisman 2004 Thorn Ridge Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"The vineyard is in a cool area of this sprawling appellation southwest of Sebastopol, but the heat of the vintage shows in the wine's relative softness and ripeness of fruit. The cherries, raspberries and dates are almost, but not quite, cooked, bringing to mind a Fig Newton cookie. Scores high on the deliciousness scale, but it's not a wine for the cellar. Drink now.",,,46.0,Thorn Ridge Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,California,US,Talisman
1404,88,Luca 2006 Laborde Double Select Syrah (Uco Valley),"Controlled berry and plum aromas are pure and not mucked up by too much oak. Like all Luca wines, this Syrah is bulky, full-framed and meaty. It's extracted but well balanced, with mellow fruit and a dark, crusty finish. Very pleasant and chunky, but not overwhelming.

1406,88,Naia 2006 Naiades Verdejo (Rueda),"Definitely a particular wine, meaning it's fully oaked and probably not for everyone. But if you don't mind full-out barrel notes on your citrusy Verdejo, then you should like it. There's honey, toast, popcorn, pepper and vanilla aromas and flavors, all courtesy of barrel fermentation. It's also smooth and clean, with good core acidity and balance. Nice wine; not Burgundy; not for all palates.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,29.0,Naiades,Verdejo,Rueda,,Northern Spain,Spain,Naia
1407,88,Naia 2007 Las Brisas White (Rueda),"In cooler vintages like 2007, this white blend from Bodegas Naia excels. It gets going with pear, apple and light, leesy aromas in front of a citrusy palate that is a knock-off for varietal Sauvignon Blanc. Flavors of grapefruit, lime and gooseberry should be familiar, and the crisp fresh-lettuce finish is a winner. Good stuff for the money.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,11.0,Las Brisas,White Blend,Rueda,,Northern Spain,Spain,Naia
1408,88,R.L. Buller & Son 2004 Calliope Limited Release Durif (Rutherglen),"Despite substantial alcohol (16.5%), this admirably concentrated wine doesn't show that much heat, nor does it show any roasted, cooked character. Instead, it delivers black olive, leather and cassis flavors just tinged with mint and a fresh, lively finish hinting at coffee. The tannins are soft but present, helping to balance a hint of residual sugar. Drink now–2012.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,35.0,Calliope Limited Release,Durif,Rutherglen,,Victoria,Australia,R.L.

1409,88,Sandeman NV 10-Year-Old Tawny  (Port),"This has a fine bite, offering its richness on the edge of a knife. Wood and fruit tannins are very evident, giving the concentration a dry, fresh core, over which dried fruit flavors pass.

1410,88,Tarapaca 2005 Zavala Red (Maipo Valley),"Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 7% Syrah and 6% Merlot, this presents wonderfully pure, expressive notes of mint, cassis and vanilla. It just lacks that extra touch of textural richness to put it in the top category. A prebottling sample of the 2007 was more impressive.",,,26.0,Zavala,Red Blend,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Tarapaca

1412,88,Trivento 2006 Golden Reserve Syrah (Mendoza),"A big, woody, totally modern style of Syrah. There is a lot more coconut, mocha and big berry fruit than anything you might find from France. It's dark and layered on the palate, with coconut and resin supporting black fruit.

1413,88,Valori 2003 Vigna Sant'Angelo  (Montepulciano d'Abruzzo),"This wine has beautiful complexity and balance backed by a soft, generous personality.

1415,88,Work 2004 Zinfandel (Howell Mountain),"Made in an exotic style, this Zin is ultra-concentrated in fruit and rich in tannins, in the way of a Howell Mountain red wine. It's complex in spicy currants, Dr. Pepper, Tabasco, chocolate and anise. A little soft in acidity, but should mellow out for years.",,,29.0,,Zinfandel,Howell Mountain,Napa,California,US,Work
1416,88,El Coto 2000 Coto de Imaz Gran Reserva  (Rioja),"Like you might expect from a maturing gran reserva, Imaz offers glimpses of raisin, sweet berry and even some aged cheese. In the mouth, it's all about red fruit, although an earthy undertone provides some background. Feels a little stark, zesty and lean, while the finish is solid and tastes of vanilla and leather.

1418,87,Baglio di Pianetto 2004 Ramione Red (Sicilia),"Ramione is a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Nero d'Avola that delivers a unique and very attractive mineral quality.

1419,87,Capel Vale 2005 Regional Series Shiraz (Mount Barker),"Mixed berry, cola and cedar notes dominate the nose, while the palate is packed with cherry cola and leather flavors.

1540,90,Hugel 2010 Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Despite its richness, this is an elegant, balanced wine. The acidity is a fine partner to the ripe white fruits and spice-driven edge. It is dry and full bodied, with the possibility of aging for a couple of years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,,Gewürztraminer,Alsace,,Alsace,France,Hugel
1541,90,Joanne Weir 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This soft, lush Cabernet features lots of richness. At four years old, it's drinking well now, with mocha-infused black cherry, cassis and cedar flavors.",,,42.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Joanne Weir
1542,90,Judith Beck 2011 Blaufränkisch (Burgenland),"The partner to Beck's Zweigelt, this is every bit as complex and structured. It has a solid, firm feel, with darkly tannic fruit, a broad texture and a hint of toast. This is for aging for at least a year. Screwcap.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,20.0,,Blaufränkisch,,,Burgenland,Austria,Judith Beck
1543,90,K Vintners 2009 Stoneridge Vineyard Merlot (Washington),"This is a very firm, tight and focused effort, with a clean cherry flavor. It is not at all like most Washington Merlots, which are often heavily influenced by new oak aging. Here is a concise, pure expression that may come across as a little monochromatic, perhaps because it seems to be somewhat shut down at the moment. Made using grapes from 10-year-old vines, it shows great promise.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,45.0,Stoneridge Vineyard,Merlot,Washington,Washington Other,Washington,US,K Vintners
1544,90,Kuentz-Bas 2010 Trois Chateaux Sylvaner (Alsace),"The name Trois Chateaux  (three castles) refers to the three ruined towers that lurk over the Kuentz-Bas village of Husseren.

1547,90,Emile Beyer 2010 Lieu dit Hohrain Pinot Gris (Alsace),"In 2007, this was produced as a late-harvest wine. In 2010, by contrast, it is a crisp, apple- and pear-flavored wine. It has bright fruit, lively acidity and just an edge of sweetness.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,Lieu dit Hohrain,Pinot Gris,Alsace,,Alsace,France,Emile Beyer

1550,86,Scheid Vineyards 2015 Pinot Noir (Monterey),"Warm red-cherry aromas meet with light hints of sage and leather on the very shy nose of this bottling from one of the region's larger growers.

1552,86,Stemilt Creek 2014 Ascent One-half Mile Closer to the Moon Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Aromas of wood spice, dill, vanilla and cherry are at the fore.

1561,86,LangeTwins 2016 Prince Vineyard Chenin Blanc (Clarksburg),"A grassy grapefruity aroma and fresh citrus flavors make this medium-bodied wine refreshing, while a touch of sweetness on the palate and finish takes off the edge of acidity.

1562,86,Lionel Osmin & Cie 2016 San de Guilhem Kaléidoscope White,"It's no wonder this wine is called Kaleidoscope: a blend of Viognier, Gewürztraminer, Riesling and Muscat, it's unique and multifaceted. The varieties have come together very satisfactorily, giving perfumed and plenty of ripe fruitiness.

1564,86,Miolo 2012 Millésime Brut  (Vale dos Vinhedos),"Briny grassy aromas of apple and citrus are yeasty as well. This Chardonnay-Pinot Noir blend is foamy and active, while flavors run towards slightly bitter and yeasty, with fruit hard to find. A similar finish renders this good but with issues.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,30.0,Millésime Brut,Champagne Blend,,,Vale dos Vinhedos,Brazil,Miolo
1565,86,Salton NV Intenso Brut Sparkling (Serra Gaúcha),"A light color and tropical aromas of lime and lychee set up a full but flaccid palate.

1567,86,Terrapura 2015 Pinot Noir (Chile),"For value-priced Pinot, give this its props for being fair and consistent with past vintages. On the nose, this smells a bit furry and spicy, with meaty plum and tea notes.

Drink now.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,12.0,Reserva,Portuguese Red,,,Douro,Portugal,Adega Vila Real
1569,86,Amador Cellars 2013 Aglianico (Amador County),"Full bodied and firmly tannic, this bold wine has lots of berry and cherry flavors, tangy acidity and plenty of tannin, too. It tastes dry, almost tart, and leaves an astringent effect on the finish, so it needs to pair with rich fatty foods that balance it out.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,36.0,,Aglianico,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,California,US,Amador Cellars
1570,86,Arrowood 2014 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),"Two vineyards go into the making of this wine, including Stonestreet Estate.

1571,86,Bacalhôa Wines of Portugal 2016 Alabastro by Quinta de Terrugem Red (Alentejano),"This young and fruity wine has soft tannins and the typical warm rich character of Alentejo.

1573,86,Bodegas Carrau 2011 Amat Cerro Chapeu Tannat (Uruguay),"At first, this Tannat smells chalky and minerally; later it's leafy and a touch soapy in aromas. A fierce angular palate delivers tart black-plum flavors with tea notes. The finish is linear and long due to hard-driving acidity.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,32.0,Amat Cerro Chapeu,Tannat,,,Uruguay,Uruguay,Bodegas Carrau

1575,86,Casa Perini 2012 Quatro Red (Vale Trentino),"A sniff of this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tannat and Ancellotta is like a walk through the sawmill. Given how oaky this smells, it's no surprise that the palate is resiny in feel, with dry woody plum flavors. Additional oak dominates the finish on this one-dimensional barrel blaster.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,60.0,Quatro,Red Blend,,,Vale Trentino,Brazil,Casa Perini
1576,86,Casanel 2015 Patricia Marie Pinot Gris (Middleburg),"This wine starts off on notes of lemons, almond skins and mushrooms.

This is simple in body and has a long nutty finish.",Carrie Dykes,,18.0,Patricia Marie,Pinot Gris,Middleburg,,Virginia,US,Casanel
1577,96,Andrew Will 2007 Sorella Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"In this new vintage of Sorella, Cabernet Sauvignon is again right out front at 72% of the blend. Here the fruit seems more subdued, the wine tight, the dense tannins showing graphite and mineral more than new barrel flavors. It definitely needs decanting.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,64.0,Sorella Red Wine,Red Blend,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Andrew Will
1578,96,Ojai 2007 Clos Pepe Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Huge, rich, white Burgundy style Chardonnay. Has a pie-filling fruity richness of pineapples, lemondrop, pears, kiwi fruit and exotic kumquats, balanced with fine, minerally acidity, and wrapped into a buttercream texture. The oak is flamboyant, but perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume. Dazzling and dramatic, from a vineyard that just keeps performing better and better.",,,38.0,Clos Pepe Vineyard,Chardonnay,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,California,US,Ojai
1579,96,Andrew Will 2007 Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine Red (Red Mountain),"A completely different blend from the winery's 2006 Ciel, this reflects Chris Camarda's growing enchantment with Cabernet Franc, which is now 45% of the blend. Most of the rest is Merlot—a Right Bank style. The concept works. It captures the sleek minerality of the site, and puts the fruit into tight, laser-like focus. The wine seems almost crystalline—sharp-edged and reflective, with penetrating angles and offset flavors.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,53.0,Ciel du Cheval Vineyard Red Wine,Red Blend,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Andrew Will
1580,96,Rulo 2007 Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Superb fruit highlights this tight, sculpted Syrah. It's extremely dense, with deep and intense raspberry and cassis fruit flavor, augmented with coffee grounds, smoke and iron filings. Complex, detailed, balanced and deep—what more can a wine give you? This is drinking very young and surely needs to be decanted. But already displaying amazing power.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,20.0,,Syrah,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Rulo
1581,95,Williams Selyem 2008 Allen Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Amazingly rich, one of the most opulent Chardonnays you can drink now. Just wows the mouth with pineapple, pear, exotic tropical fruit, crème brûlée, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors that go on and on through the finish. Also shows fine, tart acidity, which provides needed balance. Yes, it's superripe, but this is what California Chardonnay does at its best.",,,50.0,Allen Vineyard,Chardonnay,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Williams Selyem
1582,95,Le Chiuse 2004 Riserva  (Brunello di Montalcino),"Le Chiuse has produced one of Montalcino's brightest stars with this Riserva 2004 (the base 2004 Brunello didn't impress us as nearly much). This is a delicious wine that you will enjoy on every level. The intensity and purity of the fruit and spice aromas are impressive and the mouthfeel is extra-plush and supple. Yet, those firm tannins give it the balance and structure it needs.",,,120.0,Riserva,Sangiovese Grosso,Brunello di Montalcino,,Tuscany,Italy,Le Chiuse
1583,95,Tantara 2007 Talley Rincon Chardonnay (Arroyo Grande Valley),"Massively rich, with pronounced, sweet, smoky oak flavors and a rich vein of tart, creamy lees highlighting the underlying fruity ripeness.

Tremendously delicious and compelling.",,,38.0,Talley Rincon,Chardonnay,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Tantara
1584,95,Melville 2008 Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),"Massive, opulent, oozing in pineapple créme brulée, honey, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors. Totally decadent, and fortunately set off with brisk, citrusy acidity. Calling all lobsters, and don't forget the drawn butter. Sheer hedonism in a glass, at a fantastic price.",,,26.0,,Chardonnay,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,California,US,Melville
1585,95,Andrew Will 2007 Champoux Vineyard Red Wine Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"A unique version of Andrew Will's Champoux, this is more than half Cabernet Franc, with Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot filling in the rest. Thick and tannic, yet perfectly ripe and almost silky, it coats the palate with black cherry, graphite, slate and a bit of chalk. All that said, the fruit more than holds its own against the terroir's minerality. Drink this with your best steak, and give it plenty of breathing time.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,53.0,Champoux Vineyard Red Wine,Red Blend,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Andrew Will
1586,95,Au Bon Climat 2007 Los Alamos Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),"Massively fruity and oaky, this is an atom bomb of a Chardonnay. You either love this style or you hate it. The pineapple tart, apricot, pear, peach, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla cream and cinnamon spice flavors go on and on. Beyond the utter richness is firm acidity and a bracing minerality. Defines California-style decadence, but drink now, as the wine will quickly go downhill.",,,25.0,Los Alamos Vineyard,Chardonnay,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,California,US,Au Bon Climat
1587,95,Fort Ross 2007 Fort Ross Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"What a beautiful Pinot Noir for drinking now with lamb chops or maybe a rich, exotic Ahi tuna tartare. Brilliantly crisp in acidity, with a clean, bracing mouthfeel, it offers dazzlingly rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, orange zest, Dr. Pepper cola and Asian spices, with smoky oak adding elaborate tiers of vanilla char. For the price, it's a very great buy.",,,37.0,Fort Ross Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,California,US,Fort Ross
1588,95,Buty 2007 Rediviva of the Stones Red Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,55.0,Rediviva of the Stones Red,Red Blend,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Buty
1589,94,Tantara 2008 Bien Nacido Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley),"Superrich, ripe and flamboyant, if not particularly subtle. Dazzles for its tsunami of grilled pineapple custard, pear tart, golden mango and Key lime pie richness, accented with sweetly, caramelized oak, and brightened with brisk acidity. A racy, decadent crowd pleaser.",,,38.0,Bien Nacido Vineyard,Chardonnay,Santa Maria Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Tantara
1590,94,Henri Bourgeois 2008 Le M.D. de Bourgeois  (Sancerre),"The initials refer to the vineyard of Mont Damné, the steepest vineyard in Sancerre.

1591,94,Vineyard 7&8 2007 Estate Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Bring this bottle straight to the cellar. Don't even think about opening it before, say, 2013. All you'll get is a mouthful of hard, sandpapery tannins. But it's a very deeply flavored Cabernet, packed with massive blackberry, black currant, plum and cedar flavors, and there's a granitic minerality that must come from the soil. Very finely crafted.",,,125.0,Estate,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spring Mountain District,Napa,California,US,Vineyard 7&8
1592,94,Quinta do Vallado 2007 Reserva Field Blend Red (Douro),"From old, mixed planting vineyards in the Quinta do Vallado, this is an impressively complex blend of flavors, from rich spice, smooth tannins, the richest plum juice and a gorgeous, opulent texture. It is ripe, drinkable now, but likely to benefit from several years aging.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,60.0,Reserva Field Blend,Portuguese Red,,,Douro,Portugal,Quinta do Vallado
1593,94,Mercy 2008 Cedar Lane Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco),"An absolutely delicious Pinot Noir. Hard to exaggerate the drinkability factor. Supremely ripe cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted by brilliantly crisp acidity to make it all bright and lively. Oak plays second fiddle, contributing rich, tasteful notes of smoke, vanilla and buttered cinnamon toast. Just gorgeous for drinking now and for the next 5–6 years with your best fare.",,,35.0,Cedar Lane Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Arroyo Seco,Central Coast,California,US,Mercy
1594,94,Andrew Will 2007 Two Blondes Vineyard Red Wine Red (Yakima Valley),"This Two Blondes is the best ever—powerful and ripe, with a plush mix of raspberry and strawberry fruit, tart and tangy and mouthfilling. This wine has a huge midpalate, but doesn't stop there; as it slowly winds through a full-throttle finish, threads of chocolate, coconut, caramel and coffee appear. The flavors go on for several minutes.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,46.0,Two Blondes Vineyard Red Wine,Red Blend,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Andrew Will
1595,93,Conspire 2009 Sauvignon Blanc (Rutherford),"A beautiful, fancy Sauvignon Blanc, crisp and dry and complex.

1597,92,Gramercy 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Though mostly Cabernet from an excellent Horse Heaven Hills vineyard, this also includes 15% Merlot from Pepper Bridge. It coats the tongue with velvety softness and drying tannins. It suggests elegance and breed immediately, Cabernet's classic cassis married to herbal grace notes and a strong mineral streak. A lovely food wine.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,42.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Gramercy

1600,92,Iron Horse 2008 Native Yeast Chardonnay (Green Valley),"This is a very rich Chardonnay. It has complex, lush flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes, oranges and the smoky vanilla notes from 100% new oak. High acidity fortunately provides crisp balance. Almost too much of a good thing, it calls for equally rich fare, such as lobster or Ahi tuna tartare.",,,46.0,Native Yeast,Chardonnay,Green Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Iron Horse
1601,92,J. Bookwalter 2007 Protagonist Red (Red Mountain),"Lushly aromatic and toasty, the substantial oak flavors are set against deep, brambly berry and cassis fruits. There are subtle suggestions of mint and some alcoholic heat, and an interesting orange peel scent carries into the mouth. The tannins are big and ripe and not at all bitter or too heavy.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,50.0,Protagonist,Red Blend,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,J. Bookwalter
1602,92,Laetitia 2007 La Colline Pinot Noir (Arroyo Grande Valley),"A vigorous, masculine Pinot Noir. Dark in color, tannic and acidic, it has the weight of Grenache, although with silkier tannins. The flavors are impressively ripe and deep, suggesting raspberries, cherries, currants and a baked pie crust quality from oak. A bit ponderous now. Give it a good, long decant, or hold for up to six years.",,,60.0,La Colline,Pinot Noir,Arroyo Grande Valley,Central Coast,California,US,Laetitia
1603,92,Maroon 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville),"This Cab is drinking very dry, tannic and austere in its youth. It really needs time in the cellar to soften and throw some sediment, and allow the heart of black currants and dark chocolate to emerge. Should begin to show interest after 2013.",,,42.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Yountville,Napa,California,US,Maroon
1604,92,Martin Ray 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Cruz Mountains),"A beautiful wine for drinking now, although it will take a few years in the cellar.

1605,92,Quilceda Creek 2007 Palengat Red (Horse Heaven Hills),"Quilceda's Palengat is now a proprietary blend, not a strict Cabernet as before. You can smell the violets amidst nicely layered aromatics, built upon layers of black fruits, cassis and dark, smoky elements. Smoke, earth, coffee, a hint of iron and rock continue into the midpalate, which loses a little density as it moves through the finish. That may be a reflection of the young-ish (7 to 10 year old) vines.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,85.0,Palengat,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Horse Heaven Hills,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Quilceda Creek

1817,87,Muscardini 2009 Tesoro Red (Sonoma Valley),"There are lots of delicious flavors in this smooth blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah. It impresses for its voluptuous flavors of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and sweet oak.

1834,89,Oregon Territory 2014 Tempranillo (Oregon),"From Paul O'Brien, a producer with multiple versions of Tempranillo, comes this budget offering. It spent 18 months in 30% new French oak, which suggests that these were declassified barrels originally meant for the pricier wines.

Tart black cherry, cassis, coffee liqueur, vanilla and a light streak of metal all combine to make this a full fascinating example.

1841,89,Eola Hills 2014 Barrel Select Reserve Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This spent about a year in 30% new oak, and some portion was American. Those aggressive scents and flavors still dominate, with the typical vanilla and pickle-barrel highlights. More bottle age is in order for maximum enjoyment.

Initial notes of balsamic blow off to reveal notes of brandied cherries and dried hay.

2101,89,The Terraces 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Dark berry, leather and herbaceous notes on the nose open to cherry, currant and tobacco flavors—it's all very much in the Bordeaux vein. The mouthfeel is similar: somewhat lean and angular but very flavorful, with an expansive cherry flavor on the spicy, long finish. Has good tannic structure, and may merit a higher score with some age. Hold for four to six years, and then drink til 2012.",,,60.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,The Terraces
2102,89,Karl Lawrence 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Interesting aromatics of cumin, tree bark, chocolate and more on top of black fruit: cassis and plum, mostly.

Rich, plush and drinkable almost immediately.",,,40.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Karl Lawrence
2103,89,Dry Creek Vineyard 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Dry Creek Valley),"A creamy drop of vanilla turns the red fruit this way and that; at one moment it's peppery and offers tastes of fennel, and then it is pure plums and cassis. Dry, dusty and earthy, this wine shows solid fundamentals. The early line is for a strong future.",,,35.0,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dry Creek Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Dry Creek Vineyard
2104,89,August Briggs 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Mountain),"Black fruit with a touch of prune and meat on the nose.

2105,89,Merryvale 1997 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Rich, dense and cool, with an overt menthol streak. The fat, tangy fruit has a cedar edge and also a pronounced piercing quality.

A year or two on its side should help it along.",,,39.0,Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Merryvale
2106,89,Robert Mondavi 1997 SLD Cabernet Sauvignon (Stags Leap District),"A little prune, cherry and tobacco mix on the nose with some leafiness, creating a bouquet similar to Bordeaux.

2107,89,Conn Valley 1997 Eloge Red (Napa Valley),"Fine berry fruit, dried flowers, and an olive note mark the intriguing nose of this very dry, even austerely elegant blend.

2108,89,Cain 1997 Concept Red (Napa Valley),"A mix of Cabernet, Cab Franc and Syrah, this out-of-the-ordinary blend is a little funky and meaty, but still offers lots of juicy black fruit and a whole lot of toasted oak.

2109,89,Lolonis 1997 Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Redwood Valley),"Easy-drinking, this is an example of a lighter, but still very satisfying style of Cabernet.

Sweet-and-sour stewed berry flavors and black-toast accents play on the fairly large-scaled palate. A tart chocolate note enters on the finish, which displays firm but fine tannins.

2112,89,Domaine Denis Gaudry 1999 Pouilly Fume  (Pouilly-Fumé),"Crisp, with grapefruit aromas and flavors, this is textbook Loire Sauvignon Blanc. A mild smoky, mineral note adds complexity, and the full fruit is clean and ripe, yet not at all sweet. Pulls it all off with lots of class and style.

2175,83,Kenos 2013 Tempranillo (Cachapoal Valley),"An incongruous mix of plastic, olive, oak and green berry aromas sets up an abrasive palate. This is strange at all checkpoints, with heavily oaked, leathery flavors of herbal berry fruits. A fiery finish that runs heavy on green notes is the close.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,10.0,,Tempranillo,,,Cachapoal Valley,Chile,Kenos

2180,83,Famiglia Meschini 2015 Unoaked Chardonnay (Casablanca Valley),"Aromas of pink grapefruit and passion fruit are more in the Sauvignon Blanc field than your typical Chardonnay.

2181,86,Granite Springs 1999 Syrah (El Dorado),"Country style, with its rough, earthy tannins and brambly berry flavors.

2185,86,Kunde 1999 Shaw Vineyard Century Vines Zinfandel (Sonoma Valley),"What does “briary” mean? Think about a wild black raspberry bush on a hot summer afternoon. The wood, the bark, the dust, the chlorophyll from the baking leaves and the berries, with that wild, primitive, spicy, fructose-sweet bitterness.

2186,86,Stonehedge 2000 Zinfandel (California),"Pretty nice for a statewide appellation, with true Zin characteristics of wild, brambly berries. The alcohol is high and the wine is very dry, a full-throttle assault on the senses, with its maximum load of jammy fruit.

2187,86,Calina 2000 Reserve - Cabernet Sauvignon/Carmenere Red (Maule Valley),"A straight shot down blackberry lane. The palate is all about the fruit; it's got lots of texture, and maybe even some tannins to shed. Finishes with gravel, herb and a certain meatiness.

2194,86,Stonehedge 1999 Zinfandel (Napa Valley),"Comes down firmly on Zin's wild and wooly side. The brambly berry and pepper flavors are accompanied by savage tannins, not big and heavy, but jagged and rustic. High alcohol creates a hot aftertaste, and the wine is fermented to dryness.

2202,85,Salena Estate 2001 Chardonnay (Riverland),"This warm-climate Chard shows its origins in its ripe, sweet peach-nectar aromas, kissed with caramel and smoke.

2811,91,Tanner 2013 Estate Grown Petite Sirah (Sierra Foothills),"Richness and density highlight this full-bodied and deftly oaked wine that smells like baking spices and black pepper sprinkled on ripe black cherry and dark chocolate. The texture is very inviting, almost thick, and beautifully marries the ripe fruit with velvety tannins.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,35.0,Estate Grown,Petite Sirah,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,California,US,Tanner
2812,91,Tablas Creek 2015 Patelin de Tablas Blanc White (Paso Robles),"This blend of 56% Grenache Blanc, 23% Viognier, 12% Roussanne and 9% Marsanne from nine vineyards offers a pretty nose that mixes Key lime, honeydew, just-ripe nectarine and lily florality. It's bright and fresh on the tightly wound and texturally intriguing sip, with lime pith and lemongrass flavors.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,25.0,Patelin de Tablas Blanc,Rhône-style White Blend,Paso Robles,Central Coast,California,US,Tablas Creek
2813,91,Uvaggio 2014 Radix Vinea Zinfandel (El Dorado),"Concentrated fruit flavors, full body and a smooth, broad mouthfeel make this wine soothing and satisfying to drink. Made from vines growing on their own roots, the wine delivers a ripe berry and cherry character that floods the palate and lingers nicely on the finish.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,24.0,Radix Vinea,Zinfandel,El Dorado,Sierra Foothills,California,US,Uvaggio
2814,95,Guastaferro 2008 Primum  (Taurasi),"From one of Taurasi's rising stars, this gorgeous wine opens with enticing scents of underbrush, just-picked violet, dark berry and a whiff of cake spice. The balanced, full-bodied palate delivers layers of mature black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, carob and cocoa while firm but refined tannins and fresh acidity provide an elegant, age-worthy structure. It's already tempting but hold for more complexity. Drink 2018–2033.",Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,,Primum,Aglianico,Taurasi,,Southern Italy,Italy,Guastaferro
2815,95,Malat 2014 Silberbichl Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Lifted notions of bergamot, lemon and grapefruit set a fragrant, almost heady tone. The same riot of citrus tumbles forth from the palate—there is a linear dynamic that exudes liveliness and drive. The direct juxtaposition of ripe juiciness and tart refreshment creates an irresistible moreishness. Yes, Austria can produce intensity in such a compact, neat package that provides pure thrill.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,36.0,Silberbichl Reserve,Riesling,,,Kremstal,Austria,Malat
2816,95,Malat 2014 Steinbühel Reserve Riesling (Kremstal),"Imagine a concentration of lemon juice in an airy cloud of freshness—that is the nose of this astonishing wine.

2817,95,Testarossa 2013 Sierra Madre Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Mossy, dank, forest-floor aromas of juniper, chaparral shrub, pencil lead and spiced porcini mushrooms mix with a cooked rhubarb character on the nose of this wine from single-vineyard specialist Bill Brosseau.

2818,95,Bründlmayer 2014 Heiligenstein Alte Reben Reserve Riesling (Kamptal),"A rich, nutty note hints at hazelnut, with lively citrus laying underneath. This vein of lemony verve leads the melody like the soaring, unfettered notes of a violin against a sonorous background. This will always be firm but once it opens up, it will be even more harmonious and beguiling.

2819,95,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Ried Loibenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Herbal spice and yeasty savor overlay shining, ripe and juicy pear flavor. This is a compact but complex blend of fruit and peppery punch. There is a fine seam of citrus freshness heightening and brightening every sensation, suggesting that there is more and more to come. While this is delicious now, it holds even more peppery fruit at its core.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,53.0,Ried Loibenberg Smaragd,Grüner Veltliner,,,Wachau,Austria,Emmerich Knoll
2820,95,Château Cheval Blanc 2013  Saint-Émilion,"Smoky aromas and layers of tannin and fruit give this wine great complexity. It is smooth, juicy and fresh while also having perfumed tannins and an elegant, lightly mineral structure from the Cabernet Franc. The wine's cherries and red berries are still encased in the structure, allowing it to develop slowly. Drink from 2024.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,500.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux,France,Château Cheval Blanc
2821,95,Château Haut-Brion 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This wine is structured with impressively ripe fruit. Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases). Believed to be the oldest of the five Bordeaux first growths, Haut-Brion has been in the Clarence Dillon family since 1935.

2822,95,Château Léoville Las Cases 2013  Saint-Julien,"This impressively powerful wine has dense tannins and concentration. With 74%  Cabernet Sauvignon, it is firm, packed with black-currant fruits with intense, perfumed acidity. Cabernet Franc adds spice to the wine.

2823,95,Château Pontet-Canet 2013  Pauillac,"This wine is rich, with generous black plum and berry fruits. It has a structure that is full, ripe and that will sustain the fruitiness of the wine over many years. The sensation is of velvet, with some force behind it. This remarkable wine will develop well over the medium term and then age for many years.

2825,95,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Ried Kreutles Federspiel Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Fresh pear and lively yeast, peppery watercress and fresh citrus create a lively, appetizing nose. The palate bristles with wonderfully tingling citrus freshness that highlights all the aromatic aspects in turn: the fruitiness, the ripeness, the savory backdrop of yeast and the light-footed but concentrated core. This is still very young but so ready and utterly irresistible, yet with the mileage to age. Don't drink too quickly—you'll miss the chance of savoring the peppery aftertaste.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,31.0,Ried Kreutles Federspiel,Grüner Veltliner,,,Wachau,Austria,Emmerich Knoll
2826,95,F X Pichler 2014 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Wonderfully ripe flavors of juicy, yellow pear precede everything. With a little air, the palate gives us the full ultraspicy force of true Grüner: a real hit of freshly ground white pepper, leesy yeast notes and herbal tinges of chervil, arugula and watercress, all bound up in a smooth, concentrated but compact package with lasting, savory length and a seam of freshness.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,85.0,Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd,Grüner Veltliner,,,Wachau,Austria,F X Pichler
2827,95,Josef Jamek 2014 Ried Klaus Riesling (Wachau),"Right now, although the nose is closed, exposure to air reveals the purity of lemon oil on a taut and tight palate still singing with yeasty notes. This is in its very infancy and promises to open up beautifully with its straight, soaring backbone of freshness. Underneath all the tightly curled layers of citrus peel slumbers a salty stoniness that signals ageability; the long, lemony finish corroborates this. How utterly lip-smacking.

2828,95,Malat 2014 Das Beste vom Grünen Veltliner Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Very subtle notes of green and yellow pear peel entice the nose. The palate adds zesty hints of yellow grapefruit peel, pith and flesh that brighten a peppery herbal note reminiscent of arugula and watercress. White pepper is highlighted too.

2829,95,Malat 2014 Gottschelle Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"An almost tropical touch of passion fruit hovers above the nose as if to draw you in. Once imbibed, this reveals a concentrated but nonetheless light-footed charm that captures all the spiciness of a ripe, yellow grapefruit—pith, peel and pulp. This is appetizing with immense drive and energy. At the core, however, there is a calm and confident purity. This is alive.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,36.0,Gottschelle Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,,,Kremstal,Austria,Malat
2830,95,Muhr-Van der Niepoort 2013 Spitzerberg Blaufränkisch (Carnuntum),"Very pure and lifted notes of red cherry are held tightly within a taut frame: the nose gives almost nothing away. The palate provides another glimpse of that hauntingly delicious, almost sublimated cherry note. There is something aromatic and pure, unforced and honest about this disarming wine. The structure is subtle but firm, the elegance borders on the Pinot-esque, thus the wine is slender but profound.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,49.0,Spitzerberg,Blaufränkisch,,,Carnuntum,Austria,Muhr-Van der Niepoort
2831,95,Sleight of Hand 2013 Psychedelic Stoney Vine Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"The winery's first release off its estate vineyard in The Rocks offers expressive, captivating aromas of peat, dried flowers, fire pit, herbs, grilled asparagus, funk and green olive.

2832,95,F X Pichler 2014 Dürnsteiner Liebenberg Smaragd Grüner Veltliner (Wachau),"Perfumed peach is edged with citrus, yeast and a hint of pepper on a very enticing nose. The palate tinges the fruit with far more savoriness: the full force of yeasty spice, something herbal and salty and incredibly moreish. Citrus also provides a wonderfully high-toned dimension that suggests pink grapefruit zest and kumquats. This is toned, concentrated and full of verve.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,62.0,Dürnsteiner Liebenberg Smaragd,Grüner Veltliner,,,Wachau,Austria,F X Pichler
2833,95,Château Margaux 2013  Margaux,"This wine is smooth, ripe with fine tannins and red plum and black-currant fruits that are soft and gentle. Acidity dominates at this stage, supported by the tannins. It brings out the fruit and freshness of the year while also keeping some structure from the high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. Drink from 2025.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,395.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Margaux,,Bordeaux,France,Château Margaux
2834,95,Château Montrose 2013  Saint-Estèphe,"This is a firm wine although with superb fruit. It is structured and dense, dark with tarry tannins as well as juicy fruitiness.

Drink from 2025.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Saint-Estèphe,,Bordeaux,France,Château Montrose
2835,95,Domaine de Chevalier 2013  Pessac-Léognan,"This is a beautiful wine, fresh with acidity and structured with a mineral texture. Layers of creamy citrus and white fruit flavors go along with touches of wood aging that are well integrated. It's a wine to drink for its freshness soon, although it will also benefit from several years aging. It will be best from 2018.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,110.0,,Bordeaux-style White Blend,Pessac-Léognan,,Bordeaux,France,Domaine de Chevalier
2836,95,Eichinger 2014 Lamm Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kamptal),"Initially tightly closed on nose, this wine slowly emerges with time in the glass. The palate is more expressive, with sprightly lemon, aloe vera and the soothing notion of ripe green and yellow pears. There are pleasing shadows of pepper and herbal spice, but what is most convincing is the compact, complete fluidity with which this envelopes the palate. Another masterpiece that is so very true to its vintage from Birgit's talented hands.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,38.0,Lamm Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,,,Kamptal,Austria,Eichinger
2837,95,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Ried Pfaffenberg Selection Riesling (Wachau),"An enticing smell of lemon sorbet fills the nose and the effect on the palate is much the same: bracing, cleansing deliciousness pervades everything. There is a hint of crunchy, crisp green apple combined with far richer notions of lemon zest and mandarin peel. Deeper down resides an earthy, yeasty core and a salty, stoniness. This is very young now and will show its true but thrilling citrus-tinted colors with some bottle age.

2838,95,F X Pichler 2014 Dürnsteiner Kellerberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"A barely-there glimpse of lemon bids you to step closer and take a sip. The palate unfolds in a still tightly contained bundle of lemon zest and juiciness. There is an undertow of riper texture, reminiscent of bitter orange zest and just as full of aromatic promise. This is wiry and slender but will mellow into seductive freshness and slick, almost cheeky tartness. With this concentration, it has all the makings of a flavor bomb and is something to really look forward to.

2839,95,Malat 2014 Alte Reben Höhlgraben Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"A touch of flint on fleshy peach is followed by juicy citrus and ripe pear bedded in nettle and watercress. Together they present an immensely enticing nose, hinting at whole oceans of luscious fruit beneath the surface. The palate then invokes all the varietal spice: white pepper, arugula and chervil, illuminated by bright, zesty citrus to finish in a concert of layered zestiness. Overtones of orange and pink grapefruit zest make it even more compelling. Lip-smackingly irresistible and a paradigm of its vintage.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,36.0,Alte Reben Höhlgraben Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,,,Kremstal,Austria,Malat
2840,95,Proidl 2014 Senftenberger Ehrenfels Reserve Grüner Veltliner (Kremstal),"Watercress and fleshy apricot meet in this wine and make that incongruous combination work. A savory undertone of yeast adds a deeper dimension where pepper, chervil, lovage and stone abandon themselves to riot. This so comes alive in the mouth and demands your attention. Wonderful balance, ripe fruit and a whole lot of savory play!",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,,Senftenberger Ehrenfels Reserve,Grüner Veltliner,,,Kremstal,Austria,Proidl
2841,94,Emmerich Knoll 2014 Loibner Federspiel Riesling (Wachau),"The alluring lightness of scent here conjures up citrus-flavored snowflakes—symmetrical and delicate little crystals of lemony deliciousness that melt on the tongue one by one, releasing a constant stimulus of utterly joyous freshness—whichever cloud they fell from. It simply bursts with lemon and grapefruit zest, and even with lime. Slender, incisive purity echoes long in a blizzard of bracing and lasting thrill.",Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,29.0,Loibner Federspiel,Riesling,,,Wachau,Austria,Emmerich Knoll
2842,84,Candido 1997 Riserva Red (Salice Salentino),"Emanating from the heel of the Italian boot, close to the beautiful city of Lecce, this is one of Puglia’s classic wines. The grapes are Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera. Pleasant cherry-berry aromas and flavors predominate. The structure is ample, as is the mouthfeel. The tannins need some softening. The finish is long. Grilled lamb would make a fine accompaniment.",,,8.0,Riserva,Red Blend,Salice Salentino,,Southern Italy,Italy,Candido
2843,84,Hermann J. Wiemer 1997 Cuvée Brut 2000  (Finger Lakes),"Overtly sweet aromas and flavors dominate this upstate New York offering. Wiemer’s wines have impressed us before, but this comes off as heavy-handed, with a dense, perfumey quality. It possesses decent length and texture, but the weighty sweetness makes it a better candidate for mimosas or for entertaining those who shy away from dryness.",,,23.0,Cuvée Brut 2000,Champagne Blend,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,New York,US,Hermann J.

2844,84,Delbeck NV Cramant Brut  (Champagne),"Aromas of apple cider, lemon and egg custard open this wine. Similar flavors on the palate, however, bear a bit of a musty note, yet the citrus is definitely there.

2845,84,Château Mas Neuf 1998 Red (Costières de Nîmes),"Exhibits superripe Grenache aromas and flavors of apricots and cherries, all in a midweight format.

2846,84,Sella & Mosca 1995 Marchese Di Villamarina Cabernet Sauvignon (Sardinia),"Considered the flagship of the century-old Sella & Mosca fleet, this edition of 100% Cabernet Sauvignon disappoints. The supporting structure is fine, but the cherry fruit present on the nose and palate is too lean. The finish is short, too. This highly regarded wine is just not showing well at this time. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",,,35.0,Marchese Di Villamarina,Cabernet Sauvignon,Sardinia,,Sicily & Sardinia,Italy,Sella & Mosca
2847,84,Freixenet NV Spumante  (Penedès),"The aromas are a bit candy-sweet, like pink bubble gum and Lifesavers, and in the mouth that impression of sugar is confirmed.

2848,84,Château Frank NV Célébre Crémant  (New York),"A very light floral nose opens to an apple-cider and clove palate.

2849,84,Santini NV Spumante  (Moscato d'Asti),"Distinctly lime-scented, almost like lime soap, and slightly sweet.

2850,84,Bolla 1999  Valpolicella,"Seems confected, with sweet Jolly Rancher aromas playing against taut acidity. A light, tart offering best paired with tomato-based sauces—fine with spaghetti at your local Italian joint.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,9.0,,Red Blend,Valpolicella,,Veneto,Italy,Bolla
2851,83,Bellavista 1991 Vittorio Moretti Reserve Cuvée  (Franciacorta),"The nose here is odd yet mildly appealing, with perfume and corn tortilla notes. Flower and fruit notes play on a palate accented by a soft mouthfeel and easy mousse. The finish shows a little length and a buttery, honeyed note, but overall it has a disjointed quality.",,,100.0,Vittorio Moretti Reserve Cuvée,Champagne Blend,Franciacorta,,Lombardy,Italy,Bellavista
2852,83,Grandin NV Brut Sparkling (Vin Mousseux),"Earth and hay aromas open to an earthy tart-apple palate. There's an unusual mushroom note overall, and only a faint bead.

2853,83,Terrale 1998 Primitivo (Puglia),"Definitely not Zinfandel-like, despite its Primitivo origins; a rather nondescript wine, as a matter of fact. Light cherry overtones are noted on the nose and palate. The tannins are mouth-drying. This is certainly not a good example of how far Puglia has come with this grape. However, it would work fine with a slice or two of pizza.",,,5.0,,Primitivo,Puglia,,Southern Italy,Italy,Terrale
2854,83,Mezzacorona 1999 Pinot Grigio (Trentino),"Everything else is okay in this clean, fresh wine, but the meager amount of apple fruit puts it in the lightweight category.

2855,83,Sartarelli 1999  Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi Classico,"One of the hallmarks of Verdicchio is its high, lemony acidity. This wine certainly displays plenty of citrus aromas and flavors.

2856,82,Audubon Cellars 1997 Picnic Hill Vineyard Late Harvest Zinfandel (Amador County),"Exaggerated, burnt aromas of sun-dried tomato, raisins and plum liqueur don’t roll out the red carpet. Sweet (5.35% RS) and fruity, but also tannic and on the rough, earthy side. Ultimately it finishes short.",,,14.0,Picnic Hill Vineyard Late Harvest,Zinfandel,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,California,US,Audubon Cellars
2857,82,Korbel 1997 Master's Reserve Blanc de Noir  (Russian River Valley),"This beery bubbly, with its flinty fruit and mouth-puckering acidity, is fine for parties or using as a mixer.

2858,82,Remo Farina 1997 Ripasso  (Valpolicella Classico Superiore),"The ripasso technique consists of passing the already completed “normal” Valpolicella back over the lees of the Amarone in the spring after vinification of the latter is complete. This results in a minor refermentation, adding extra alcohol and flavor. If the latter occurred in this particular version, it is not very evident. There is a modest amount of dry fruit present, but the mouth-searing acids and mouth-drying tannins hurt this wine.",,,12.0,Ripasso,Red Blend,Valpolicella Classico Superiore,,Veneto,Italy,Remo Farina
2859,82,Terrale 1998 Bianco White (Sicilia),"Terrale translates as “product of the earth,” and that’s about all one can say about this wine. The grapes used are Catarrato, a white variety indigenous to Sicily, and the ubiquitous Trebbiano. A light apple nose starts it off, and the structure is good, with adequate acids. However, the finish is short and lacks flavor.",,,5.0,Bianco,White Blend,Sicilia,,Sicily & Sardinia,Italy,Terrale
2860,82,Luna Di Luna NV Extra Dry White (Veneto),"This sparkling relative of a popular Italian table wine has a floral nose with a perfume quality. “Sweet” is the operative word here, with an almost candied edge to the fruit.

2862,81,Great Western NV Brut  (New York),"Anyone familiar with native varieties of grapes will recognize the “foxy” aromas and flavors in this otherwise well-made bubbly.

2863,80,Cristalino NV Extra Dry  (Penedès),"A strong wine, both in terms of aromas and flavors. There’s a delicacy and lightness to the body, but the intensity of its flavors is assaultive; it’s a combination of peaches, warm cheese and a hint of something very dry and citrusy. Roquefort notes indicate that there may be some bacteriological problems.",,,9.0,Extra Dry,Champagne Blend,Penedès,,Catalonia,Spain,Cristalino
2864,95,Taittinger 1995 Comtes de Champagne Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"A beauty in every respect. The nose is perfectly toasted, with attractive apple and peach nuances.

2865,95,Laurent-Perrier NV Grand Siècle La Cuvée Brut  (Champagne),"One expects elegance, grace and precision from this prestige cuvée, and this wine delivers that and much more.

2866,94,Acacia 1997 Lee Vyd Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"From the Napa side of Carneros, this beautiful wine begins with very forward aromas of cola, black raspberry, black cherry, tomato, mushroom, earth, vanilla, spice and smoky oak.

2867,93,Acacia 1997 St. Clair Vyd Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"This lovely, powerful wine is very similar to the Lee Vineyard bottling, but slightly more backward. The fruit and spice aromas are a little earthier, like sniffing a handful of rich, moist humus. In the mouth, there’s just a tad more tannin, indicating, possibly, slightly longer ageability, while the finish is a bit harder.

2868,93,Robert Mondavi 1998 Reserve Pinot Noir (Napa Valley),"If you must open this now, let it breath for a while because it’s dumb, as they say, on opening. Airing and swirling reveal more earthy things than fruit. There’s a hint of truffles, of bark, and you almost have to close your eyes to imagine the blackberries and cherries buried deep down inside, but they’re there. You can taste them in the midpalate, and the finish lasts for a long time.

3350,87,Sean Thackrey NV Pleiades XXV Old Vines Red (California),"It's very difficult to rate this unusual bottling in a blind tasting. It's a nonvintage dry red wine blended from mature years and has few if any peers in California. It's very tasty because of traits that are usually considered flaws. A tawny color and an aroma like tawny Port lead to a very soft texture, and warm plum, raisin and nut flavors. The wine is rather full in body, light on tannins, and tastes quite mature and mellow.",Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,24.0,Pleiades XXV Old Vines,Rhône-style Red Blend,California,California Other,California,US,Sean Thackrey
3351,87,Shenandoah Vineyards 2015 Special Reserve Zinfandel (Amador County),This is a great value for a wine from the celebrated Amador region. Aromas like strawberry jam and brown sugar lead to very ripe and fruity flavors in this full-bodied but lively wine.

3352,87,Socré 2013 Roncaglie  (Barbaresco),"This opens with French oak, exotic spice, coconut and toast aromas.

3354,87,Stottle 2013 Dineen Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yakima Valley),"This opens with cherry cordial, cranberry, herb and barrel spice aromas that seem a bit off.

3355,87,Portal del Montsant 2011 Santbru White (Montsant),"Fully mature, oxidized aromas include a heavy note of popcorn and oak along with aged pear and apple. This wine is ripping with acidity, while flavors lean towards salty, lightly baked apple. A finish based mostly on acid means this should stay vital for years to come.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,27.0,Santbru,White Blend,Montsant,,Catalonia,Spain,Portal del Montsant
3356,87,Ampelos 2015 Ampelos Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta.

3364,87,Carmen 2014 Gran Reserva Los Quillayes Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Heavy oak on the nose means aromas of pencil lead, wet cement and blacktop are in the lead.

3365,87,Castellroig 2014 Terroja de Sabaté i Coca Xarel-lo (Penedès),"Briny citrus-peel aromas show a pyrazinic green side and a touch of corn tortilla.

3366,87,Château des Bormettes 2016 Cuvée Hélène White (Côtes de Provence La Londe),"From vines close to the sea, this wine does have a salty tang to its ripe soft fruits.

3378,88,Miner 2007 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"This is a big, rich, extracted, dryly tannic Cabernet. The suggestion is ageability, but the wine seems to lack the dynamic tension to ride out the years. It has plenty of ripe blackberry fruit, but snaps to a quick finish. Quite good, but a disappointing expression of the Stagecoach Vineyard.",,,65.0,Stagecoach Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Miner
3379,88,Mont Marçal 2008 Rosado Brut Sparkling (Cava),"A subtle wine made entirely from Trepat.

3380,88,Occasio 2010 Del Arroyo Vineyard Rose of Pinot Noir Rosé (Livermore Valley),"Occasio continues to build its case for being a winery to watch out of the Livermore Valley, releasing this lively, raspberry and honeycomb rosé made from Pinot Noir grapes out of its Del Arroyo Vineyard. The Pommard clone fruit was cold soaked in stainless steel, then pressed from the skins and racked again into stainless steel.

3381,88,Polkura 2008 Malbec (Colchagua Valley),"Very sweet and lush on the nose, and teetering on overripe due to prune and raisin aromas. The palate, meanwhile, is more narrow than you might expect, with big tannins and extract. Tastes of black plum, blackberry and herbal notes. A ripe, loud wine that's a little clumsy but definitely big and fruity. 200 cases made.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,23.0,,Malbec,,,Colchagua Valley,Chile,Polkura
3382,88,Roessler 2009 Gap's Crown Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Roessler produces lots of single-vineyard wines, but this has not been one of their best ones. It's a good wine, not without interest, with plenty of compact cherry, raspberry and sandalwood flavors. But it's very acidic.

The fruit is a mix of Bing cherry and strawberry, washed in a lush barrel-induced mix of chocolate, mocha, espresso and clove.

3388,88,Abadía da Cova 2008 Barrica Mencía (Ribeira Sacra),"Smoky, rubbery and suggestive of bacon and toast on the nose. The palate is more crisp and snappy, with juicy flavors of red currant, cherry and spice.

3389,88,Avide 2005 Sigillo Red (Sicilia),"A blend of Nero d'Avola and Cabernet Sauvignon, Sigillo shows soft fruit and blackberry aromas backed by a touch of the greenness—bell pepper or crushed clove—usually associated with Cabernet. There's heft and structure in the mouth.",,,,Sigillo,Red Blend,Sicilia,,Sicily & Sardinia,Italy,Avide
3390,90,La Chablisienne 2006 Mont de Milieu Premier Cru  (Chablis),"A ripe, full wine, immediately accessible, speaking both of minerality and fresh acidity. The fruit goes right to the green apples, kiwi and juicy lemon flavors, but the structure is bold and rounds out these crisp fruits. A wine for aging, perhaps 2–3 years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,35.0,Mont de Milieu Premier Cru,Chardonnay,Chablis,,Burgundy,France,La Chablisienne
3391,90,Milbrandt 2006 Traditions Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA)),"From a mix of Milbrandt vineyard sites, this outstanding blend includes small amounts of Cabernet, Syrah, Malbec and Barbera.

3392,90,Montes 2008 Limited Selection Leyda Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Leyda Valley),"Smells like an ocean breeze mixed with field greens, citrus and passion fruit. Montes has been a leader in Chile's movement toward coastal SB, and this one is blasting with grapefruit, green apple, passion fruit and minerality.

3393,90,Odfjell 2004 Orzada Cabernet Franc (Maule Valley),"Dark as night, with aromas of brick dust, kirsch and black fruit. Don't expect anything like French Cab Franc from this Chilean monster. It's huge and fully directed toward blackberry and cassis. Which means the herbal, leafy, tobacco notes common to CF are simply not present here. But if you like yours big and burly, with crusty dark fruit, then this is your ticket.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,20.0,Orzada,Cabernet Franc,,,Maule Valley,Chile,Odfjell

The bouquet shows hickory, roasted plum, chocolate, vanilla and peanut. The palate, meanwhile, is all about pure cassis, blackberry, mocha and spice.

This is 100% varietal. Light and elegant, it's nicely detailed with a peppery, floral character and a welcome persistence.

3400,90,Kali Hart 2007 Chardonnay (Monterey County),"This is a sort of second tier wine from Talbott.

3403,90,Milbrandt 2006 Traditions Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Here is another great value from the Milbrandt brothers, based upon their impeccable vineyard sources (they own 1600 acres, mostly in the Wahluke Slope AVA). Dense and dark, ripe and compact, this Cab/Merlot/Petit Verdot blend brings plenty of macho and muscle, layers of black fruits, black smoke, black tea and black olives. Get the idea?

3405,90,Olivier Leflaive 2006 Montée de Tonnerre Premier Cru  (Chablis),"Firm and tight, a wine that reveals more structure than fruit initially, leaving the citrus and grapefruit flavors to emerge later.

From first impressions, which include aromas of toast, coffee, prune and devilish berry, you know it's a good one.

It's what the winemaker modestly describes as his “leftovers,” but like the best leftovers it tastes great.

3962,87,The Great Oregon Wine Company NV Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This nonvintage wine comes packaged in 187ml cans (four to a pack)—each good for one generous glass pour. Pleasant cherry flavors carry it through, and it's a fine porch pounder, or safe on a hike or campout (just pack the cans back out).

3974,87,Montes 2015 Limited Selection Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmenère (Colchagua Costa),"Rubbery black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked, so much so that this Cabernet-Carmenère blend smells charred but also like plastic. A big grabby palate is jagged in feel, while this tastes like the nose suggests, meaning oaky, herbal and like berry fruits and plum.

The reward for farming such difficult terrain, the owners believe, is complexity, character and concentration. That is certainly the case in 2004, as this is the most dense and focused of the six WillaKenzie releases.

It's dry, grippy in dusty tannins and complex, with earthy flavors of coffee, cherries, tobacco, blackberries and Asian spices. What it is not is overly alcoholic and sweet, as so many Zins are.

4032,92,Finca la Celia 2013 Heritage Single Vineyard Malbec (Uco Valley),"Prune, raisin and gamy black-fruit aromas fold in a note of iodine.

4037,92,Plantagenet 2014 Chardonnay (Great Southern),"This is a terrific Chardonnay at a great price, offering subtle notes of toasted grain upfront, followed by bright lemon-lime fruit and crisp acidity. It's medium-bodied, so it won't overpower whatever food you serve it with and the laser beam of citrusy acidity on the finish is wrapped in a gauzy sheath of pleasant nuttiness.

4042,92,Jean Edwards 2013 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Black currant stars in this mountain wine, juicy and brushy in big, pillowy tannin. Still tightly wound, it shows complexity and plenty of natural structure, begging for more time in the bottle to allow for the gunpowder, smoky oak and dark, lush black fruit to marry further.

4047,92,Domaine Terlato & Chapoutier 2012 L- Block Shiraz (Pyrenees),"This partnership between the Rhône's Michel Chapoutier and his American importer seems remarkably consistent.

4052,92,Tyrrell's 2011 Vat 1 Semillon (Hunter Valley),"At six years of age, this is just coming into its own. Hints of green fruit remain, tempered by notes of wet stone and toasted marshmallow, harbingers of the full maturity that will arrive in a few years.

4057,92,Château Labégorce Margaux 2014  Margaux,"This is a firm wine, dominated by tannins and dark layers of wood.

4065,92,Seven Hills 2014 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain),"Aromas of barrel spice are up front on this locked-up wine, followed by pencil lead, herb, vanilla, black currant and cherry. The palate brings a compelling sense of texture, juxtaposed by aggressive tannins that need a significant amount of time to come into their own.

4068,92,Undurraga 2013 Vigno Old Vines Dry-Farmed Red (Maule Valley),"Piercing black cherry and cassis aromas are a touch rustic and massive, but hey, that's old-vines Carignan from Maule (this one also contains 12% Cinsault). So saturated that it's beastly on the palate, this tastes of hard-rolling blackberry and black plum. Plenty of gritty spice, tomato and integrated oak fill out the menu.

4074,92,Kooyong 2015 Estate Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula),"The 2015 vintage in Mornington yielded dark concentrated wines. This one is atypically (for the estate) full bodied and bold as a result, with plum and black-cherry fruit and hints of mint, sage and bay leaf.

4175,87,Markham 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Franc (Napa Valley),"This Cab Franc has some nice features, starting with the cherry and herb flavors that finish dry and spicy.

4177,87,Novy 2010 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),"This is tremendous in blackberries, currants and plums, with grilled meat and black pepper notes, and the tannins are rich and profound. Right out of the screwtop, however, there's a tinny, metallic taste that detracts.

4181,87,Saget la Perrière 2010 Domaine des Grandes Esperances Les Ailes Pourpres Cabernet Franc (Touraine Amboise),"A cool Cabernet, fresh rather than structured.

4788,87,McIlroy 1999 Aquarius Ranch Merlot (Russian River Valley),"A wine that elicits mixed feelings. On the plus side, subtle fruit and oak, with a rich earthiness and sleek tannins. Does a good job of keeping Merlot fat and plump, while maintaining an herbal character. On the other hand, there's pronounced acidity and a sharpness that shows up on the finish. Doesn't seem likely to age well, but you never know. —S.H.",,,21.0,Aquarius Ranch,Merlot,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,California,US,McIlroy

4790,87,Ventana 1999 Reserve Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco),"Barrel fermentation, malolactic fermentation and lees aging add buttery, creamy, spicy complexities to this clean, steely wine.

4795,87,Hahn 1999 Meritage (Santa Lucia Highlands),"The Santa Lucia Highlands are quickly becoming known for growing exceptional Pinot Noir, but this wine shows that the region also has potential for Bordeaux varieties.

4796,87,Gallo of Sonoma 1999 Laguna Vineyard Chardonnay (Russian River Valley),"Seems somewhat crisper and less weighty than prior vintages, with the custardy mouthfeel buttressed by lemony acids.

4799,93,Sheridan Vineyard 2004 Reserve Syrah (Yakima Valley),"This is just 14.2% alcohol, so despite the richness and ripeness, this is not fat or flabby.

4801,93,Keenan 2005 Reserve Mailbox Vineyard Merlot (Spring Mountain District),"This bottling has turned out to be one of California's more important Merlot releases. The '05, like its immediate predecessors, is a dry, richly tannic wine of great elegance and structural complexity.

The bouquet opens immediately into a fascinating complexity. What wafts up from the glass is a heady mix of incense, smoke, jam, toast, iron and herb—you can spend a pleasant 10 or 15 minutes just counting all the threads.

The Shafer Hillside Select is the inspiration for the extended barrel aging and the focus on round, sweet tannins.

Rich black cherry fruit provides the solid base, but after that the wine tightens down, so decanting would be essential if you plan to drink it soon.

This is a dark wine, just this side of brooding, with ripe blueberry and cherry fruit, softly chalky tannins, whiffs of smoke and splashes of pepper.

This is complex, quite youthful and tightly woven.

5194,92,Jayson 2005 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"This is the first Pinot from the Napa house of Pahlmeyer, the result of many years of effort in his vineyard in the Fort Ross area of the true Sonoma Coast. The result is rich in cherry pie, raspberry liqueur, cotton candy, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon flavors that captivate from sip one, but there's a certain young vine simple directness that limits the score. As the vines age, the wine is one to watch.",,,65.0,,Pinot Noir,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,California,US,Jayson

Streaks of tar and some lively cinnamon spice add life to the fruit, which is solid and earthy. I pick up black licorice, vanilla cream, and still more interesting flavors wrapped into the tannins, which seem dusty and smoky and a bit grainy.

5288,85,Viña El Cerno 2006 Utopía Roble Malbec (Mendoza),"Dry and short on fruit, with strong barrel aromas of pepper, cinnamon and resin. In the mouth, there's more wood than fruit, leaving heat, vanilla and spice to overshadow mild strawberry/raspberry flavors.

5292,85,Susana Balbo 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"Expensive for what you're getting. The wine starts with a reddish-green set of aromas, which are backed by generic red-fruit flavors that are medium to narrow in scope and just don't taste much like Cabernet.

5295,85,Finca El Retiro 2006 Barrica Malbec (Mendoza),"Melted fudge and asphalt are draped on this young wine's bouquet. Given that opening, a palate of black plum and cassis isn't surprising.

5296,85,Budini 2007 Malbec (Mendoza),"Creamy and rooty at first, and then smokier and darker as it settles. For young Malbec it displays both a jammy fruit side and an acidic center. So there's both ripeness and heft but also a piercing sizzle. Perfectly good for parties and less-serious imbibing.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,11.0,,Malbec,Mendoza,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Budini

5301,87,Chateau Ste. Michelle 2006 Indian Wells Chardonnay (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Consistent with previous bottlings, this is dark, oaky, lush with scents and flavors of butter, toast and roasted nuts. The fruit seems secondary to the parade of butterscotch, brown sugar and spice that comes walloping through the palate. The wine turns slightly bitter in the finish.

Apple, pear and peach fruit dominates, and the sometimes too-present, tarted up flavors of butter and vanilla have been brought back into better proportion in this 2006 bottling.

5304,87,Felipe Rutini 2006 Malbec (Mendoza),"Smoky and big on the nose, with crusty black-fruit flavors backing that up. The wine is less deep and more hard and scratchy than some Mendoza Malbecs, but it's solid and sure-footed even if the mouthfeel is stark. Probably better with food than others due to its leaner, less opulent style.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,19.0,,Malbec,Mendoza,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Felipe Rutini
5305,87,Fernwood 2005 Small Vineyard Selection Merlot (Santa Cruz Mountains),"More like Zin than Merlot, a peppery, full-bodied wine with some ripe to overripe blackberry, cassis and raisin flavors.

Along with the color come stiff, substantial tannins; once in the mouth, however, the wine sets a different course, turning rather light and fruity.

5310,87,San Rustico 2004  Amarone della Valpolicella Classico,"This vintage of San Rustico's Amarone seems more closed and reserved compared to last year.

5313,87,Three Rivers 2006 Weinbau Vineyard Cabernet Franc (Wahluke Slope),"There's 5% Malbec in the blend, but the austere, scrapey tannins of the Franc still dominate the finish. The fruit is pretty, with blueberry character to burn.

5319,87,Alta Vista 2006 Premium Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"A little heavy and teetering toward overripeness, but it holds the line despite issuing aromas of raisin, heat, leather and marinated meat.

5630,89,Harper Voit 2013 Perrydale Hills Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This sports some chewy, herbaceous qualities that hit you right away.

5637,93,Aril 2008 Syrah (Atlas Peak),"Atlas Peak's reputation for Syrah can only grow as a result of this wine. It shows the massively dense fruit and firm mountain tannins of the appellation, as well as the ageability of Atlas Peak Cabernet Sauvignon, with which this Syrah could easily be confused.

The tannins are extraordinarily thick, but ripe and smoothly sweet.

6395,91,Château Fonréaud 2011  Listrac-Médoc,"Spicy new wood flavors dominate this otherwise strongly fruity wine. The tension between the two promises a rich, full and ripe wine for the future.

6398,91,Angel Vine 2011 Primitivo (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Primitivo is a close relation to Zinfandel, and it slides easily into the Angel Vine lineup which includes four other Zins. This carries a touch more earthiness than the others, with darker fruits and a distinctive streak of espresso.

6399,91,Bouchaine 2012 Bacchus Collection Estate Vineyard Pinot Meunier (Carneros),"Pinot Meunier is seldom bottled on its own. Vintners prefer to use it in sparkling wine blends. But Bouchaine is serious about it, and with this 100% varietal wine, has succeeded in producing a Pinot Noir-esque wine of great beauty.

6401,91,Château Cos Labory 2011  Saint-Estèphe,"A very dry wine, it shows the traditional Saint- Estèphe hard tannins.

6406,91,Duckhorn 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Hard tannins make this wine difficult to approach now, as they usually do for young Duckhorn Cabs. But it's quite a success for the chilly 2010 vintage, showing lush blackberry and cherry fruits and fine acidity. As tough as the tannins are, they're well structured, a strong suggestion that the wine, which includes Merlot, should have an easy time aging.

6418,86,Pascual Toso 2005 Magdalena Toso Limited 40 Barrels Malbec-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza),"The wine is called 40 Barrels and every bit of those barrels is crawling on this Malbec-Cab blend. For starters, it smells more like hickory than fruit. Soon blackberry and prune aromas and flavors get into the game, but even then the back palate and finish are resiny.

6421,86,Tagaris 2006 Alice Vineyard Petit Verdot (Wahluke Slope),"This is warm and loose, with fruit that is very ripe and just on the verge of pruney. The ripe fruit flavors seem to soften the tannins, which are also quite ripe and smooth.

The fruit here is ripe and lush, with plenty of herbal essence, and for every drop of plum or black cherry there's a balancing hint of green herb and bell pepper, which does not signal underripeness.

6466,86,Esperto 2001 Pinot Grigio (Delle Venezie),"A rather hard, minerally wine, without the approachability of so many Pinot Grigios, but showing a more stony and focused side to this grape's personality. The flavors are clean and crisp; lime and barely ripe nectarines provide tartness and vivacity.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,13.0,,Pinot Grigio,Delle Venezie,,Northeastern Italy,Italy,Esperto
6467,86,Testarossa 2001 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"Lots of flavor packed into this light-bodied, smoothly textured wine, although it's a bit one-dimensional.

6472,86,La Palma 2002 Estate Bottled Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot (Cachapoal Valley),"Very forward and young, with an overt, grapey style. This wine doesn't walk lightly, as it starts out more positive than it finishes.

The palate has a choppy, rough feel and then comes an onslaught of medicinal berry flavor that leads to a tight, biting finish that's big on acid and low on depth of flavor and intracacies you might expect for $80.

6484,85,Concha y Toro 2009 Xplorador Chardonnay (Central Valley),"Quiet on the bouquet except for a dusting of oak and banana. The palate is heavy and wide, if a bit flabby, and the flavors of melon and mango run sweet, much like fruit punch. Soft and sweet on the finish as well, and overall it's good but generic.

Extremely dark in color, it offers unctuous black currant, graphite and licorice aromas.

6717,90,Thorn Clarke 2013 Shotfire Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Barossa),"Firmly tannic, this is the rare example of a lower-priced wine that deserves some time in the cellar.

6722,90,Bright Angel WInes 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"Built around a core of acidity, this wine conveys a preponderance of cedar and sage, seemingly influenced by a softer variety like Merlot, of which it has 12%.

6738,90,Fitapreta 2013 Baga ao Sol Baga (Alentejano),"This is an unexpected wine, unoaked Baga in the Alentejo rather than its home territory of Bairrada. The result is a wine that certainly hasn't lost its fierce tannins while gaining a rich, full black fruit character.

6747,83,Carmel 1999 Valley Wines Petite Sirah (Shomron),"Opens with solid grape and red-currant fruit accented by tobacco, but on the palate the wine is light for a Petite Sirah, usually a hefty wine.

6752,83,Giacomo Mori 1998 Castelrotto  (Chianti),"As much as we like the retro package, this time the contents are just too one-dimensional.

6853,94,Bergström 2009 de Lancellotti Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),"A concentrated core of pure, sweet raspberry and cherry fruit is showcased in a wine of remarkable penetration and length. The fruit, from a biodynamic estate vineyard, is perfumed and open, making this immediately accessible and supremely enjoyable.

6854,94,Couloir 2010 Monument Tree Vineyard Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"The vineyard has been source to Pinot Noirs from Copain and Drew, and this one, from Winemaker Jon Grant shows a somewhat Cabernet-esque interpretation. The wine is dark, tannic and medium-bodied, and quite extracted in the flashily ripe cherry and cola fruit that Monument Tree ripens so well in a cool, long hangtime year like 2010. Despite the richness, this is an elegant, ageworthy wine, whose low alcohol will delight many who critique California Pinot Noir for clumsiness.

6855,94,De Loach 2009 Nova Vineyard Zinfandel (Lake County),"De Loach reaches into Lake County, not usually thought of as Zinfandel country, with tremendous results. This is a great wine by any standard. It shows some heat from high alcohol and some shriveled raisin tastes, but that's part of a ripe Zin's charm.

6857,94,Notre Vin 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Howell Mountain),"A huge wine, almost old-fashioned in its tannins. They're so strong, they freeze the palate with astringency, like a shot of Novacaine. It's also very dry, despite sweetly ripe blackberry essence, licorice and dark chocolate. All indications are that this is an ageworthy wine.

6860,94,Frazier 2008 Memento Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.",,,110.0,Memento,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Frazier

6868,94,Ken Wright 2010 Freedom Hill Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"A marvelous vintage for Freedom Hill, this high-acid Pinot is loaded with black cherry fruit. Rich, ripe, full, tart and penetrating, it might seem one-dimensional at first, but it has such excellent focus and depth that the fruit simply rocks.

It is still young, with intense citrus flavors, so wait to drink until 2016.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,18.0,Fleur de,Chardonnay,Beaujolais-Villages,,Beaujolais,France,Domaine du Clos du Fief
7390,88,Chehalem 2013 Three Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This blend of the three estate vineyards is the first Pinot to be released from each vintage. Here it spent time in 22% oak, roughly half new. Cranberry, pomengranate, dried herbs and some gently earthy tannins combine in a tart, gulpable style.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,32.0,Three Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Chehalem
7391,88,Henri Abelé NV Brut Rosé  (Champagne),"This wine, with its acidity, is so crisp and bright. Touches of red fruits give the wine a riper character, although what makes it most attractive is the freshness and the delicious fruity aftertaste. Drink this bottle as a fine apéritif.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,55.0,Brut Rosé,Champagne Blend,Champagne,,Champagne,France,Henri Abelé
7392,88,Innocent Bystander 2013 Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley),"This reflects the Yarra region's Pinot Noir character well, combining earthy, cola- and beet-scented notes with well-ripened tannins and medium body. There's a fair bit of textural richness for such a modestly priced Pinot. Drink now.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,20.0,,Pinot Noir,Yarra Valley,,Victoria,Australia,Innocent Bystander
7393,88,Jeeper NV Brut Grand Assemblage  (Champagne),"This small négociant house blends wines from 37 different villages to produce its nonvintage cuvée. The wine is balanced, fresh while also ripe with attractive acidity and grapefruit and lemon flavors. A fine orange tang at the end leaves a wine that is bright and deliciously lively.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,75.0,Brut Grand Assemblage,Champagne Blend,Champagne,,Champagne,France,Jeeper
7394,88,Lorenzi Estate 2011 Lot 451 Syrah (Temecula Valley),"Stewed olallieberries and black cherries gain nuance from concentrated red rose petals, cola and gravel on this wine from Riverside County. Like many of this winery's bottlings, the palate shows lots of barrel influence, with strong vanilla elements laced amidst blueberry and lighter red fruits.",Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,48.0,Lot 451,Syrah,Temecula Valley,South Coast,California,US,Lorenzi Estate
7395,88,Dutton Estate 2013 Manzana Vineyard Dutton Ranch Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"This is a full-bodied wine, soft and smooth with integrated tannins, yet robust in black cherry and graham cracker.

7396,88,Espaço Rural 2013 Dornas Branco White (Alentejano),This is a delicious wine full of ripe fruit tones. It is richly textured while keeping plenty of freshness from the Antão Vaz that dominates the blend. It has a firm mineral background that gives structure. The finish brings a zippy orange zest note.,Roger Voss,@vossroger,19.0,Dornas Branco,Portuguese White,,,Alentejano,Portugal,Espaço Rural
7397,90,Cass 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Cass has been focusing on Bordeaux reds in Paso Robles; their Cab Franc has been very good, and this Cabernet Sauvignon is better. It shows its warm origins in very ripe fruit flavors of blackberries, currants and chocolate, but the structure is enlivened with fine acidity and rich, dusty tannins. Delicious and dry, it shows an elegance that makes it irresistible.",,,42.0,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Paso Robles,Central Coast,California,US,Cass
7398,90,Domaine de la Sauveuse 2006 Cuvée Philippine Red (Côtes de Provence),"Like the estate's Cuvée Carolle, this has a note of volatility and sur-maturité, but it's also bigger, richer and more extracted, with lots of ripe tannins but also thick purple fruit that comes through on the finish.

7399,90,Gary Farrell 2005 Ramal Vineyard Pinot Noir (Carneros),"The Ramal Vineyard has been source to a fine series of Buena Vista Pinot Noirs. Farrell has captured another interpretation of its terroir, not quite as lush or ripe, but firm in acid-inspired cherries and licorice, with a subtle veneer of smoky oak. It's a dry, crisp young wine, well-structured, a good partner for upscale fare such as lamb chops.",,,50.0,Ramal Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,California,US,Gary Farrell
7400,90,Seven Hills 2005 Ciel du Cheval Red Red (Red Mountain),"A beautifully structured Bordeaux blend from one of Washington's great vineyards. This spent about 18 months in French oak, and another 9–10 months in bottle. It is sleek and somewhat austere at first, but sculpted and evocative, with subtle, mixed fruits and impressions of steel and gunpowder. As the fruit comes up it shows some pretty blackberry and black cherry character, nicely balanced and set to evolve over the next decade or more.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,30.0,Ciel du Cheval Red,Red Blend,Red Mountain,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Seven Hills
7401,90,Soléna 2005 Willakia Pinot Noir (Eola-Amity Hills),"The vineyard name is a combination of the two prevalent soil types, Nekia and WillaKenzie. The Dijon clone Pinot is dark and pleasantly earthy, with core flavors of cassis and cherry liqueur. The earthy, slightly rustic tannins coat the throat, leaving an astringent, green tea residue, but the silky fruit compensates. This needs some further bottle age to really shine.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,35.0,Willakia,Pinot Noir,Eola-Amity Hills,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Soléna
7402,90,Twisted Oak 2006 %@#$! White (Sierra Foothills),"The honeyed aroma of this Rhône blend of Marsanne, Roussanne, Rolle and Viognier makes it immediately attractive, but then the flavors kick in, and it turns into a roller coaster ride. Apricot jam, peaches, pears, pineapples, butter-sautéed plaintain, vanilla custard, star anise, lemon crème brûlée, the list goes on and on. The finish is fully dry and the alcohol is refreshingly low. Drink now.",,,24.0,%@#$!,Rhône-style White Blend,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,California,US,Twisted Oak
7403,90,Marega 2003 Holbar Bianco White (Friuli),"Here's an intense, slightly oxidized, 80-20 blend of Riesling and Chard that is redolent of apple, pear, pine nut, resin and maple syrup. The wine has loads of personality and complexity and is very unique in a non-commercial way. The word Holbar refers to the acacia wood casks used to age the wine.",,,,Holbar Bianco,White Blend,Friuli,,Northeastern Italy,Italy,Marega
7404,90,Viña Pérez Cruz 2003 Cot Reserva Limited Edition Malbec (Maipo Valley),"It's not often that we come across Chilean Malbec (Cot) with several years of bottle age, but this offers that and a little more. The nose is pure, with herbal hints and plenty of sauvage character. Roundness and depth give it length on the palate, which is endowed with solid berry flavors and proper savory accents. A wine with personality that's drinking perfectly right now.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,22.0,Cot Reserva Limited Edition,Malbec,,,Maipo Valley,Chile,Viña Pérez Cruz
7405,90,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2006 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"The Estate Vineyard bottling shows a definite meaty, almost Rhone-like aroma, but this is no Syrah. It's a very elegant, light, sultry bottle of Pinot Noir. The tart black cherry and currant fruit is shadowed by smoke and cinnamon, but the balance throughout is light and delicate.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,45.0,Estate Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Willamette Valley Vineyards
7406,89,Chatter Creek 2005 Clifton Hill Vineyard Syrah (Wahluke Slope),"Clifton Hill Syrah looks and smells the way you'd hope it would, black in the center, purple/garnet at the edges, peppery and loaded with sweet grapey fruit. Viognier skins—not juice—added to the fermenter elevate the aromas with floral and citrus accents. It's juicy and fairly light in flavor, but clean and very fresh, with no new oak.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,38.0,Clifton Hill Vineyard,Syrah,Wahluke Slope,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Chatter Creek
7407,89,Clos Saint-Joseph 2004 Villars-sur-Var Red (Côtes de Provence),"This is an unusually elegant wine for Provence, from a tiny, isolated vineyard in the maritime Alps. It's a blend of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre, that's gently extracted, crimson in color and filled with intricate, delicate fragrances and flavors, ranging from violets and a hint of iodine to red cherries and maybe even a touch of apricot. Drink now and over the next few years.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,42.0,Villars-sur-Var,Rhône-style Red Blend,Côtes de Provence,,Provence,France,Clos Saint-Joseph
7408,89,Cortes de Cima 2005 Incógnito Red (Alentejano),"A wine that has become something of a cult in Portugal, perhaps because of its mystery name (referring to a time when Syrah was not permitted in Portugal). This 2005 keeps the open, ripe blackberry jam fruit, with dark chocolate and herbal flavors. It has a generous, earthy character.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,,Incógnito,Portuguese Red,,,Alentejano,Portugal,Cortes de Cima
7409,89,Domaine Sorin 2007 Terra Amata Rosé (Côtes de Provence),"More complex and richly textured than most Provençal rosés, this wine is a treat, from its mineral-laden, smoky aromas to its ripe cherry-berry flavors and layered finish.

7410,89,Dona Maria 2004 Amantis Red (Alentejano),"This rare blend of Cabernet, Syrah, Petit Verdot and Touriga Nacional works surprisingly well, emphasizing tannic structure rather than fruit. The acidity of the Cab is what keeps it from being heavy, while the dense color and herbal flavors show its southern warmth and richness. Dried plums and fresh acidity to finish.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,27.0,Amantis,Portuguese Red,,,Alentejano,Portugal,Dona Maria
7411,89,Elyse 2005 Naggiar Vineyard C'est si Bon Red (Sierra Foothills),"Napa-based Elyse is better known for their Cabernet Sauvignon, but they have reached into Nevada County, in the Sierra Foothills, for this lovely Rhône-style blend. It's soft in acidity and the tannins are melted, as you might expect from a warm-to-hot region. But the flavors are plush in jammy cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and crushed black pepper.",,,28.0,Naggiar Vineyard C'est si Bon,Rhône-style Red Blend,Sierra Foothills,Sierra Foothills,California,US,Elyse
7412,89,Andrew Rich 2005 Counoise (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Counoise—a southern Rhône blending grape—only rarely appears as a varietal wine, but this distinctive bottling makes a strong case for it. It's not just another generic red wine; it has a particular mouthfeel—elegant, almost Pinot-like—coupled with firm, slightly metallic tannins, sharp acids and accents of pepper on stone. Somehow the wine feels, more than tastes, European.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,25.0,,Counoise,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Andrew Rich
7413,89,Bernardus 2006 Chardonnay (Monterey County),"Dry and flinty, with flavors of grilled pineapples, peaches, pears and roasted hazelnuts, this wine has a stony, minerally taste.

7414,89,Brandborg 2006 Ferris Wheel Vineyard Estate Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley),"As with the other Pinots from Brandborg, this estate bottling puts the spices front and center, and matches the intensity of the fruit and barrels appropriately. This is seductive and elegant with a feminine grace. The spicy plum and red currant flavors carry some tasty barrel notes of clove and cinnamon, and the wine has a bit more intensity than its stablemates.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,38.0,Ferris Wheel Vineyard Estate,Pinot Noir,Umpqua Valley,Southern Oregon,Oregon,US,Brandborg
7415,89,Casa de Santar 2004 Red (Dão),"Somewhat tough initially, with the tannins coming before the fruit, and a distinctly lean character. But this is deceptive, because there is certainly enough fruit there to give richness after two years' aging, when the blackberry and licorice flavors will come up through all that dryness.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,17.0,,Portuguese Red,,,Dão,Portugal,Casa de Santar
7416,89,Casa de Santar 2006 Reserva White (Dão),"Ripe, soft wine that has good dense fruit flavors as well as richness. There is some new wood, but the wine remains elusive, perhaps still young.

7417,89,Waters 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Walla Walla Valley (WA)),"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, sourced mostly from Pepper Bridge and Spofford Station.

7418,89,O'Reilly's 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon),"This is hands-down the best value Pinot Noir made in Oregon, year in and year out. It's firm and full-bodied, perfectly ripe, with lovely spices that range from pepper to cinnamon and allspice. The fruit lingers in the midpalate, round and tangy, with flavors of cherry and plum.

7419,89,Pali 2006 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"This is interesting—a California take on Oregon Pinot Noir. It's sleek and spicy, with a racy spine and a very tart, dry mouthfeel. The fruit is peppery and hard; like hard candy with an herbal streak. The wine hides its almost 15% alcohol quite well, but it will reward ample breathing time.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,48.0,Momtazi Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Oregon,US,Pali
7420,89,Quinta da Romaneira 2004 Red (Douro),"The first fruits of the renaissance of this grand Douro quinta (which now also houses a luxury hotel). It is huge, revealing up-front, modern, polished black fruits that would not be out of place in Australia.

7425,88,Santa Ema 2013 Amplus Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley),"Plum and raspberry aromas are herbal and slightly grassy. On the tongue, wiry acidity feels citric.

7426,88,Santa Ema 2013 Amplus Old Vine Carignan (Maule Valley),"This dark, muscular Carignan smells cool and earthy, with a heavy dose of unintegrated oak creating woodgrain and vanilla aromas.

Without that, it would be just a crisply acidic, fresh wine, with citrus, apple, peach and honeysuckle flavors. With it, it's elevated. Excessively sweet on the finish.",,,20.0,,Pinot Gris,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,California,US,La Crema
7727,86,Sagelands 2004 Four Corners Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA)),"Price rise. With broad flavors of berry and chocolate, this is pleasant and undistinguished.

7728,86,Trapiche 2005 Oak Cask Syrah (Mendoza),"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,11.0,Oak Cask,Syrah,Mendoza,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Trapiche
7729,86,Masottina 2005 Vigneto ai Palazzi Chardonnay (Piave),"This is a simple, friendly wine with a pretty dusty, mineral quality that frames fresher aromas of pear, peach and golden apple.

7730,86,Zaca Mesa 2004 Z Three Red Wine Red (Santa Ynez Valley),"A southern Rhône blend of Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache, this wine is stylish and elegant, with a smooth, silky texture.

7735,94,Dutton-Goldfield 2009 McDougall Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),"Somewhere between the acidity and dryness, this Pinot has a terrifically interesting core. It's a subtle wine, now suggesting cherry fruit, now retreating in favor of earthier mushrooms, minerals and pine needles, framed in firm tannins.

Most of the Cabs were released last year, but they've held this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend back for extra time in the bottle. Yet it's still very tannic, stinging the gums with astringency. Underneath that is a beautiful wine, brimming with fresh blackberries and cassis, and an attractive green-olive note that's sweet and salty and umami-rich.

But by a hair, this is the best and most compelling, delicious in blackberries, blueberries and cherries.

It's a pungent, pleasant wine upon entry, with rather pale strawberry fruit. It quickly moves through the midpalate and turns lean, with tomato leaf and green tea astringency.

Thick, ripe fruit aromas are elaborated by 15 months of oak aging that adds background dimension and renderings of vanilla, cinnamon and toasted almond.

Made in a distinctive style that is clearly neither California nor Burgundy, this herbal, intense, wine puts the focus on the aromas, a beguiling mix of pine and herb.

8645,97,Château Latour 2011  Pauillac,"Big tannins and impressive fruits are the hallmarks of this impressive wine. It is also subtle, not showing all its flavors at once, hiding beneath tannins and structure. For this fruity vintage, it shows a strong sense of direct, solid structure, only allowing the strong black plum and berry flavors to come through slowly. It is for the long haul, so don't drink before 2022, even better later.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,660.0,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Pauillac,,Bordeaux,France,Château Latour

Powerful but graceful, the palate delivers a vibrant core of black cherry accented with white pepper, mineral and balsamic notes alongside youthful but polished tannins and vibrant acidity.

This bottling, which contains minor quantities of Petit Verdot and Merlot, spent 28 months in new French oak barrels. The fruit is incredibly ripe and intense, with flavors of black currants and chocolate-covered cherries. As hard as the tannins are, they must have been even more aggressive two or three years ago, so kudos to Trefethen for holding the bottle back for five years.

The 2010 Art Series certainly does that. Enticing aromas of woodsmoke, peach and pink grapefruit give way to intense flavors of citrus and stone fruit on the palate.

8890,88,Dão Sul 2005 Monte da Cal Reserva Red (Alentejano),"Herbal, almost medicinal aromas set a complex scene for this densely structured wine. The flavors throughout, while rich, are also severe, a wrinkle on the otherwise ripe façade. That certainly suggests aging, and the dry tannins support this.

8998,88,Dominio IV 2009 Midnight Skies Estate Tempranillo (Columbia Gorge (OR)),"Though already five years old, this wine still seems to need time.

9016,87,Gary Farrell 2001 Redwood Ranch Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma County),"If you like yours big and burly, then this might be the right wine for you. Applesauce and lemon meringue pie aromas lead the way toward a palate full of lemon, pineapple, tangerine and vanilla. The finish is stony and leaves a custard-like impression. It's clearly from the barrel-fermented school, but for some that may be fine. For others, however, it will feel overoaked and ponderous on the tongue.",,,20.0,Redwood Ranch,Sauvignon Blanc,Sonoma County,Sonoma,California,US,Gary Farrell
9017,87,Ledson 2000 Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),"Soft, almost mute apple and pear aromas are accented by bell pepper and some lima beans. It's a typical bouquet for Napa SB, which is followed by the flavors of white grapefruit, a little citrus pith and some vanilla. Throughout there's a hint of spicy green veggies, mostly bell pepper and jalapeños. Overall, it offers good balance, just not enough fruit to override the green character.",,,18.0,,Sauvignon Blanc,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,Ledson

9019,87,Lacheteau 2000 Sancerre  (Sancerre),"Cleaner than the producer's Pouilly-Fumé, with gooseberry and popping citrus aromas, this wine is still a bit lean. But it does offer nice grapefruit and green apple flavors atop a very tight structure.

9020,87,Lynskeys Wairau Peaks 2000 Pinot Noir (Marlborough),"A big style that manages to avoid tasting rustic or heavy.

9021,87,Lynskeys Wairau Peaks 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The rather mute nose fights to offer up some anise, white pepper and melon, but it's a deep dig to find it. Green apple, pineapple and some orange rind define the flavors, while the weight of the wine seems heavy due to lower than ideal acidity. Then again, such weight might be welcomed by the Chardonnay-drinking crowd.",,,17.0,,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Marlborough,New Zealand,Lynskeys Wairau Peaks
9022,87,St. Michael-Eppan 2000 Sanct Valentin Sauvignon Blanc (Alto Adige),"Sharp aromas of citrus mix with the odd note of petrol.

9024,87,Stonestreet 1999 Upper Barn Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Alexander Valley),"In line with this winery's penchant for oak, this fast-aging wine is buttery and heavily toasted. As a result, snappy apple or citrus fruit is harder to find than many might want it to be. Nevertheless, there's some bold lemon and creamy vanilla on the thick, mouthfilling palate. And for that, it earns points.",,,23.0,Upper Barn Vineyard,Sauvignon Blanc,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Stonestreet
9025,87,Poliziano 1998  Vino Nobile di Montepulciano,"Open and friendly, this is the epitome of a newly released wine that should sell well in restaurants and fly off the shelves of wine shops.

9028,87,King Estate 1998 Reserve Chardonnay (Oregon),"Smells oaky, with smoky vanilla and sweet, charred notes riding high over flamboyant tropical fruit aromas, including guavas and breadfruit.

The mouthfeel is soft, with flavors heavy on banana and melon. Woody characteristics such as nuttiness, particularly almonds, also pop up. To its detriment, the oak and fruit seem to be fighting each other more than complementing one another.",,,19.0,T Bar T Cuvée R,Sauvignon Blanc,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Iron Horse
9032,87,Girardet 2001 Estate Riesling (Umpqua Valley),"A lot of shale in the soils adds interest to this elegant, light, fairly soft wine. Off-dry and balanced, it represents good value.

9033,87,Castello Banfi 1999 Cum Laude Sangiovese (Sant'Antimo),"This is a new kitchen-sink offering from Banfi, featuring Cabernet, Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah. It goes full bore on the red fruit and oak, with spicy berry aromas and cherry flavors. The tannins are pretty hard, and with ample acids, this young wine currently starches the cheeks.

9034,87,Domaine A. Cailbourdin 2000 Le Cris  (Pouilly-Fumé),"This wine is so typical of the area.

9035,87,Morandé 2001 Terrarum Carmenère (Maipo Valley),"Rustic, as Carmenère should be, this single-valley offering is a good drink-with-barbecue bet.

9040,87,Thornbury 2001 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough),"The nose is grassy and full of grapefruit. In a word, it's a sharp bouquet.

A touch of spritz keeps things lively.",,,17.0,,Sauvignon Blanc,,,Marlborough,New Zealand,Thornbury
9041,87,Quivira 1999 Fig Tree Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley),"This wine has a dairy note to the nose; i.e., cheese, custard and yogurt. Lemony flavors are accented by dried baking spices, while the back palate is a touch chalky, offering some good and welcome grip. Overall, the wine seems a bit heavy.

9270,91,Jean-Baptiste Adam 2013 Wineck-Schlossberg Grand Cru Riesling (Alsace),"Pure notes of tart but ripe, red apple shine on nose and palate. They pervade this fresh, clean and dry wine with immense, appetizing juiciness. There is concentration and joy at the heart, backed by focussed, taut acidity that brightens everything.

Forward berry and cherry flavors fill the mouth, offering an accessible burst of fresh flavor in a somewhat blocky frame. There's a jolt of spice and a streak of cola, all quite tasty.

9274,91,Domaine Barmès-Buecher 2011 Steingrubler Grand Cru Gewurztraminer (Alsace),"Faint rose petal notes still perfume the peachy fruit. The palate is rich, medium sweet and honeyed, as though peach and citrus were soaked in honey. This is fresh and rich, rounded and poised, tipping the scales just a little bit more on the rich side.

9275,91,Domaine Fernand Engel 2013 Gloeckelberg Grand Cru Pinot Gris (Alsace),"The bitter-sweet edge of dark fir honey engulfs nose and palate which nonetheless has a core of bright, ripe, juicy and slightly sweet pear.

9276,91,Domaine Laporte 2014 La Comtesse  (Sancerre),"Produced from vines located between Chavignol and Sancerre, this comes from pure chalk soil. It is crisp while having a warmer, more rounded character. It's full of apple and pineapple as well as citrus fruits which are added to the young, tight mineral texture.

9280,91,Dr. Bürklin-Wolf 2014 Wachenheimer Böhling P.C. Dry Riesling (Pfalz),"Minerality takes center stage in this light-footed but penetrating dry Riesling. While the fruit profile is zesty and green—suggesting tart, under-ripe lime, tangerines and melon rinds—the palate is gilded by slick layers of candlewax and petrol, lending a dense, voluminous mouthfeel.

9281,91,Dr. Loosen 2014 Bernkasteler Lay Kabinett Riesling (Mosel),"More blossomy and mineral than ripe or ruddy, there's a demure elegance to this bristling off-dry Riesling.

9286,91,Puramun 2013 Reserva Malbec (Valle de Uco),"Right away, this smells smooth and complete, with a proper mix of berry fruit, oak and earthy aromas. This is Salentein winemaker José Galante's personal wine, and it's juicy on the palate and doesn't overreach.

9287,91,Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2013 Reserva Red (Tejo),"The wine is ripe, still young with its fresh fruits and acidity. The elements are all there to produce a dark and dense wine that has fine structure.

9292,91,Rocca 2012 Collinetta Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Coombsville),"A foundation of thick tannin and oak give size and weight to this full-bodied wine that offers waves of smoky leather, cedar, tar and black cherry on the nose and palate.

9298,86,Edwin Dyer 2011 Le Cadeau Vineyard Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),"Sharply herbal, this shows a bit of a green edge, which comes across as bitterness on the finish.

The palate is richer and introduces notions of earth and that pithy, phenolic edge of serious Grüner Veltliner.

Underneath that is grapefruit zest and pith and a herbal, stony, earthy edge. The palate is rich and curvaceous but completely toned by a pervasive, lemony acidity that lends drive and linearity. This is already approachable, which is not to say that it doesn't promise a lot of mileage: this will go on and unfold its facets of fruit. Immense charm almost plays over the fact that this is a very age-worthy wine, with a finish that's almost endless.

9339,96,Emmerich Knoll 2013 Ried Loibenberg Smaragd Riesling (Wachau),"This is so young, the yeast of the ferment still swings on the nose. Underneath that, tightly curled freshness suggests both candied lemon slices and lemon sorbet—but this needs time to unfurl its glory. Despite its slenderness, this wine has muscle and tone, structure and poise. The long finish is lip-smacking and moreish.

It's perfumed with notes of green olive, violets, dried herbs, mineral and smoked meat. The palate is tightly wound, sensuous and supple, lithe yet rich with tart fruit and savory flavors backed by tannins that need more time to come into their own—but this wine surely deserves it. It has all of the stuffing to be a 20+ year wine. Best from 2025 to 2032. Give it an extended decant if opening in the near term.",Sean P.

Wild strawberry and red cherry exude on the entry, alongside floral elements of violet and lilac.

This wine is one of the driest of the year, and offers no relief at all from alcohol and other winey compounds. If there's a single, solitary flavor, it's watered down lemon juice.

This vintage is less ripe, and so the wine has some green aromas and flavors, in addition to  blackberry. That makes the tannins stick out more.

9535,94,Côte Bonneville 2006 DuBrul Vineyard Côte Bonneville Red (Yakima Valley),"This is two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Merlot, all sourced from the estate's DuBrul vineyard. It's drinking quite well, though clearly heading into secondary fruit flavors that reflect its ongoing maturation. Cherries, plums and cassis fruits mingle, along with silky, polished tannins. Though it can be cellared indefinitely, it may be at its most delicious drinking peak currently.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,120.0,DuBrul Vineyard Côte Bonneville,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Yakima Valley,Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Côte Bonneville
9536,94,Sean Thackrey 2010 Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 115 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"Ethereally light with delicate red cherry flavor, this Pinot is soft, complex and interesting, with a racy herbal streak lurking in the background. Think a ham-and-cheese quiche gingerly sprinkled with thyme and oregano. So distinctive, one wonders what grows near this particular set of vines on the Wentzel Vineyard.",Virginie Boone,@vboone,45.0,Cassiopeia Wentzel Vineyard Clone 115,Pinot Noir,Anderson Valley,,California,US,Sean Thackrey
9537,94,Monteviejo 2008 Lindaflor La Violeta Malbec (Mendoza),"Much like the previous vintage of La Violeta, this is a fabulous Malbec with depth, density and power to spare. The bouquet yields marzipan, cola, fine leather, char and rich berry aromas. That sets up a palate with impeccable structure and huge flavors of beef jerky, mocha, black fruits and spice. The finish is massive and loaded, with licorice and mocha flavors. Drink now–2018. Only 100 cases made, with 50 imported into the U.S.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,125.0,Lindaflor La Violeta,Malbec,Mendoza,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Monteviejo
9538,94,Dyer 2008 Dyer Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District),"So rich, ripe and succulent, you can hardly keep from drinking it now. But don't. This is one for the cellar. The alcohol is a refreshingly balanced. The wine is already throwing some sediment, and more than four years of bottle age are mellowing the wine's edges, with the primary blackberry and cherry flavors developing secondary characteristics. Should begin to peak around 2016 and drink well for another decade.",,,75.0,Dyer Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,California,US,Dyer
9539,94,Gravner 2005 Amfora Ribolla Gialla (Venezia Giulia),"Amfora's copper-ornage color is completely unique in the wide world of contemporary wine. There's a luminous brightness to the wine's appearance that defies its many years of age. Matured in clay amphorae, this pure expression of Ribolla Gialla delivers a softer approach than Gravner's Breg (a white blend) and amazingly intense aromas of resin, pine nut, caramel, graham cracker and candied fruit. Firm structure and determined flavors mark the long close. You can drink it now or hold 10 more years.",,,120.0,Amfora,Ribolla Gialla,Venezia Giulia,,Northeastern Italy,Italy,Gravner
9540,94,Siduri 2011 Keefer Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),"The pedigree of this vineyard shows in every aspect. It's not just the ripe black cherry and pomegranate fruit, or the brisk acidity, or the lush, gorgeous tannin structure. It's the incredible complexity, showing all kinds of mushroom,  cola, smoked meat and spice notes. Simply gorgeous now, and should develop over the next 10 years.",,,52.0,Keefer Ranch Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,California,US,Siduri
9541,94,Giaconda 2008 Chardonnay (Victoria),"This wine eschews the current trends and sticks to its full-blown guns, remaining a broad, lush and creamy-textured wine, with open, inviting aromas of peach, cashew and pineapple. It's richly nutty and tropical at the same time, offering layers of complexity and depth to be enjoyed over the next several years.",Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,125.0,,Chardonnay,Victoria,,Victoria,Australia,Giaconda
9542,94,Bonaccorsi 2010 Cargasacchi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills),"Making Pinot Noir this sensually delicious is only half the effort. The challenge is to provide balance. Winemaker Jenne Lee Bonaccorsi succeeds wildly with this wine. The vineyard is planted entirely with the Dijon clone 115, and the wine shows the purest raspberry and cherry fruit—focused and intense. Yet there are all sorts of earthy, mushroomy, oaky complexities. Gorgeous now, and will hold for at least six years.",,,45.0,Cargasacchi Vineyard,Pinot Noir,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,California,US,Bonaccorsi
9543,94,Carol Shelton 2009 Showket Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Oakville),"An absolutely delicious Cabernet, with ripe blackberry, black currant, milk chocolate and spicy oak flavors. Beyond the richness is a superb structure of gorgeously refined tannins and just enough acidity to give balance. So easy to drink, so elegant, you could drain the bottle tonight. But it will age effortlessly through 2018.",,,75.0,Showket Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,Oakville,Napa,California,US,Carol Shelton
9544,94,Château Lagrézette 2009 Le Pigeonnier Malbec (Cahors),"A small vineyard of six acres is used to produce this magnificent incarnation of Malbec.

Keep for at least four years.",Roger Voss,@vossroger,290.0,Le Pigeonnier,Malbec,Cahors,,Southwest France,France,Château Lagrézette
9545,94,Black Kite 2010 Stony Terrace Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),"More subtle at first than the 2010 River Turn, Stony Terrace, another of Black Kite's yearly single-block designates, is earthy, savory and dense. Mouth filling in its juicy red and blue fruit flavor, it's silky and entirely seductive. Well integrated and structured, it's another fine choice for the table and for cellaring another 5–7 years.",Virginie Boone,@vboone,55.0,Stony Terrace,Pinot Noir,Anderson Valley,,California,US,Black Kite
9546,94,Terra Valentine 2010 Estate Grown Cabernet Sauvignon (Spring Mountain District),"Exceptionally ripe, concentrated mountain fruit as well as hard tannins characterize this fresh, young Cabernet. Through the tannic astringency, intense flavors of black currants, dark chocolate and the sweet sap of oak shine through. Needs time. Hold until 2016 and see how it's doing.",,,45.0,Estate Grown,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spring Mountain District,Napa,California,US,Terra Valentine
9547,94,V. Sattui 2009 Morisoli Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),"V. Sattui has quietly been producing outstanding Cabernets, and here's another. The vineyard is on the Rutherford bench, arguably the tenderloin of the appellation. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine is sumptuously rich and soft in tannins, with sour red-cherry candy, licorice, bacon and pepper spice flavors. Will age well for at least 10 years.",,,55.0,Morisoli Vineyard,Cabernet Sauvignon,Napa Valley,Napa,California,US,V. Sattui
9548,93,Avennia 2010 Gravura Red (Columbia Valley (WA)),"The name pays homage to the Graves region of Bordeaux, and the blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 6% Cabernet Franc also mimics those wines. Here the grapes are sourced from the Red Willow (Yakima Valley), Bacchus (Columbia Basin) and Klipsun (Red Mountain) vineyards. Supple, with beautifully integrated red fruits, and tannins as soft as a kiss, it's masterful winemaking from Chris Peterson, who tended the wines of DeLille for many years.",Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,35.0,Gravura,Red Blend,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Washington,US,Avennia
9549,93,Cobblestone 2009 Cobblestone Vineyard Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Atlas Peak),"An impressive Cabernet, rich and dense in fruit and oak, with tremendous tannins that are at once hard and soft. It's already throwing some sediment, and the cherry and raspberry fruit comes through in a pure, sweetly feminine manner. Should continue to evolve in the bottle for at least 10 years.",,,52.0,Cobblestone Vineyard Reserve,Cabernet Sauvignon,Atlas Peak,Napa,California,US,Cobblestone
9550,93,Tapiz 2008 Black Tears Malbec (Mendoza),"Until now, Tapiz has been a value-driven brand with no wine priced above $20. This outstanding Malbec shows that they've been holding something back. Black Tears is ripe and handsome, with almost everything in its perfect place. It's a hard-driving wine with blackberry, vanilla and coconut aromas and flavors in front of a chewy, tannin-rich finish with the mildest note of raisin. Drink this unbridled stud now through 2017.",Michael Schachner,@wineschach,59.0,Black Tears,Malbec,Mendoza,,Mendoza Province,Argentina,Tapiz
9551,93,Donum 2010 East Slope Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros),"Here's a complex young wine, vastly ripe and expressive, yet with the balance to age. Marked by a squeeze of citrusy acidity, it's rich in cherry pie flavors that are wrapped into softly firm tannins. There's a touch of beetroot that gives it an earthy complexity. A very interesting example of Carneros that should improve for 5–6 years, if not longer.",,,90.0,East Slope Estate Grown,Pinot Noir,Carneros,Napa-Sonoma,California,US,Donum
9552,93,Easton 2010 Estate Bottled Zinfandel (Shenandoah Valley (CA)),"Edgy with mountainous berry flavor, Easton's 2010 Shenandoah Valley Zin is full-bodied, generous in savory spices and blackberry flavor and intoxicatingly aromatic with a peppery, leathery finish. It's structurally able to withstand many more years in bottle, so enjoy it now or give it some time. Either way, it'll shine poured alongside peppery meat.",Virginie Boone,@vboone,32.0,Estate Bottled,Zinfandel,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sierra Foothills,California,US,Easton
9553,93,Gravner 2005 Anfora Breg White (Venezia Giulia),"Gravner's Breg (Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio and Riesling Italico) shows Sauternes-like aromas of honey, candied apricot, butterscotch, caramel and almond paste. The wine delivers a pretty orange color with copper highlights (it is famously aged in clay amphorae) with firm but velvety rich tannins. The finish is long and smooth and there's a very beautiful touch of drying mineral on the close. Hold five more years at least.",,,120.0,Anfora Breg,White Blend,Venezia Giulia,,Northeastern Italy,Italy,Gravner
9554,93,Bernard Baudry 2010 Le Clos Guillot  (Chinon),"A chalk soil vineyard gives this very mineral interpretation of Loire Cabernet Franc.

9555,93,Bernard Baudry 2010 Les Grézeaux  (Chinon),"From clay and silex soil at the foot of the hill behind the Baudry house, this solid, richly fruity wine brings out both concentrated tannins and opulent, red berry flavors.

9556,93,Bonaccorsi 2010 Bien Nacido Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley),"A terrific Pinot, wonderful for drinking now, and should develop some bottle complexity over the next 5–6 years.

9557,93,Seghesio 2010 Cortina Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley),"As always, Seghesio's Cortina is a rich, complex Zinfandel. It captures Zin's briary, brambly, spicy personality, with dense, wild forest-berry fruit, yet manages to be elegantly compact and even Cabernet-like in its tannin structure.

9559,85,Casal do Conde 2011 Reserva Touriga Nacional-Cabernet Sauvignon (Tejo),Burned wood aromas reveal the smoky nature of this wine. Wood aging and a bitter chocolate character dominate.

9560,85,Cerro Prieto 2009 La Teresa Bloc Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles),"Chocolate milk, with a squeeze of cassis liqueur and the sweet vanillins of toasted oak, are the flavors.
